The Tropical Kingbird (Tyrannus melancholicus) is native to the Americas, with a vast range extending from the southern United States through Central America, the Caribbean, and South America. These birds are commonly found in a variety of habitats, including open woodlands, savannas, and urban areas.

Characteristics:
1. **Distinctive Plumage:** Tropical Kingbirds have a distinctive appearance with olive-brown upperparts, a pale throat, and a bright yellow belly. Their contrasting coloration contributes to their overall eye-catching and identifiable look.

2. **Large Head and Bill:** These kingbirds have a relatively large head and a robust bill, which they use for catching flying insects. Their aerial hunting style involves sallying from perches to catch insects mid-air.

3. **Territorial Behavior:** Tropical Kingbirds are known for their territorial behavior, defending their nesting and foraging areas from other bird species and potential threats. They may engage in aggressive displays and vocalizations to assert dominance.

4. **Aggressive Mimicry:** One of the interesting behaviors of Tropical Kingbirds is their use of "aggressive mimicry." They imitate the calls of predatory birds to create confusion and induce fear in other bird species, causing them to abandon nests or foraging sites.

5. **Migratory Patterns:** While some populations of Tropical Kingbirds are resident throughout the year in their breeding areas, others are migratory. The migratory individuals undertake seasonal movements, particularly in response to changes in food availability and climate.
