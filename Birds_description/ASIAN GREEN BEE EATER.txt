The Asian Green Bee-eater, scientifically known as Merops orientalis, is a bird species native to parts of Asia. These bee-eaters are primarily found in regions such as the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and parts of China. They inhabit various habitats, including open woodlands, scrublands, grasslands, and agricultural areas, where they forage for insects, particularly bees and other flying insects. Asian Green Bee-eaters are known for their vibrant plumage, distinctive elongated bills, and aerial hunting behavior.

1. Plumage: The Asian Green Bee-eater exhibits vibrant green plumage on its upperparts, complemented by a contrasting blue throat and a chestnut crown. It has a slender, elongated body with long, pointed wings and a distinctive black stripe through its eyes.
2. Habitat: These bee-eaters are native to parts of Asia, where they primarily inhabit a variety of open habitats, including woodlands, scrublands, grasslands, and agricultural areas.
3. Foraging Behavior: Asian Green Bee-eaters are specialized insectivores, feeding primarily on bees, wasps, dragonflies, and other flying insects. They hunt by perching on exposed branches or wires, then sallying forth to catch insects in mid-air with their sharp bills.
4. Breeding Habits: They typically breed during the warmer months, constructing burrows in sandy or loamy soil banks for nesting. Both parents participate in excavating the burrow, incubating the eggs, and caring for the young.
5. Migration: Some populations of Asian Green Bee-eaters are migratory, undertaking seasonal movements between their breeding and non-breeding grounds. However, many populations are sedentary, remaining in their breeding areas year-round.
