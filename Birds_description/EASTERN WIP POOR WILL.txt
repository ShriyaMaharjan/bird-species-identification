The Eastern Whip-poor-will (Antrostomus vociferus) is a nocturnal bird species native to North America, found across a diverse range of habitats, including woodlands, grasslands, and scrubby areas. Its distinctive and repetitive vocalizations contribute to its nocturnal presence in the warm months of the year.

As for its characteristics:
1. **Camouflaged Plumage:** The Eastern Whip-poor-will exhibits cryptic plumage, with a mottled pattern of browns, grays, and blacks, providing effective camouflage against the leaf litter or tree branches where it often roosts during the day.
2. **Nocturnal Habits:** This bird is primarily nocturnal, becoming active at dusk and dawn. Its name is derived from its repetitive and distinctive "whip-poor-will" call, which echoes through the night and serves as a territorial marker and mating display.
3. **Insectivorous Diet:** Eastern Whip-poor-wills have a diet mainly composed of insects, including moths, beetles, and other nocturnal insects. They are skilled at catching prey on the wing using their wide mouths and specialized bristles around the mouth to aid in insect capture.
4. **Ground Nesting:** Whip-poor-wills often lay their eggs directly on the ground, relying on their cryptic plumage to conceal the nest. The eggs are well-camouflaged, and the parents rely on their protective coloration and behavior to keep the nest hidden.
5. **Migratory Behavior:** While some populations of Eastern Whip-poor-wills are resident year-round, others exhibit migratory behavior, moving to warmer regions during the winter months. This migratory pattern is influenced by the availability of insect prey and the temperature changes in their habitat.
