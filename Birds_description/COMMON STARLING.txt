The Common Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) is a bird species native to Europe and Asia, but it has been introduced to various regions worldwide, including North America, Australia, and New Zealand. Known for its adaptability and gregarious behavior, the Common Starling has become one of the most widespread and successful bird species outside its native range.

1. **Size:** The Common Starling is a medium-sized bird, with adults typically measuring around 19 to 23 centimeters in length.

2. **Plumage:** Characterized by its iridescent plumage, the Common Starling displays a glossy blackish-green color with scattered white spots, especially during the breeding season. Outside the breeding season, the plumage may appear more subdued.

3. **Murmurations:** Common Starlings are famous for their mesmerizing aerial displays known as murmurations. These synchronized and intricate flight patterns involve large flocks of starlings moving in unison, creating dynamic shapes and patterns in the sky. Murmurations serve multiple purposes, including predator avoidance and social cohesion.

4. **Vocal Mimicry:** One of the notable features of Common Starlings is their ability to mimic a wide range of sounds, including human-made noises and the calls of other bird species. This vocal mimicry is particularly pronounced in captive individuals.

5. **Foraging Behavior:** Common Starlings are omnivorous and have a diverse diet that includes insects, fruits, seeds, and human food scraps. They forage on the ground, probing for invertebrates, and also utilize open areas for feeding.

These characteristics collectively define the Common Starling as a highly adaptable and socially interactive bird species, with a global presence due to successful introductions outside its native range.
