I'm sorry, but as of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there is no information available on a bird species called "Imperial Shaq." It's possible that the term is not associated with a recognized bird species, or there might be a misunderstanding or misspelling. If "Imperial Shaq" refers to a bird species that has gained recognition or discovery after my last update, I recommend checking more recent and specialized sources for the latest information on this specific bird.
