The Wattled Lapwing (Vanellus senegallus) is native to sub-Saharan Africa, with its range spanning from Senegal to Ethiopia and down to South Africa. These distinctive lapwings are commonly found in a variety of open habitats, including grasslands, savannas, and wetlands.

Characteristics:
1. **Prominent Wattles:** The most noticeable feature of the Wattled Lapwing is the two fleshy, pendulous wattles that dangle from the sides of its face. These wattles, along with its striking black and white plumage, contribute to its distinctive appearance.

2. **Noisy Vocalizations:** Wattled Lapwings are known for their noisy and repetitive calls, often described as "kleep-kleep-kleep." Their vocalizations serve various purposes, including communication within the group, establishing territories, and alerting others to potential threats.

3. **Ground Nesting:** These lapwings are ground nesters, creating a simple scrape in the ground where they lay their eggs. Their nests are often well-camouflaged, and they fiercely defend their nesting territory, displaying distraction behaviors to draw potential threats away from the nest.

4. **Aggressive Defense:** Wattled Lapwings are highly territorial and known for their aggressive defense of their nesting sites. They may engage in aerial displays, such as tumbling flights and loud calls, to deter potential predators and intruders.

5. **Distinctive Flight Pattern:** In flight, Wattled Lapwings showcase a distinctive pattern with broad, rounded wings and deliberate, slow wing beats. Their flight display is often accompanied by conspicuous vocalizations, emphasizing their presence and territorial boundaries.
