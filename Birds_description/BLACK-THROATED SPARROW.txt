The Black-throated Sparrow (Amphispiza bilineata) is a bird species native to North America, primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This sparrow species is well-adapted to the desert environments it inhabits, displaying distinctive features within its geographic range.

Characterized by distinct features, the Black-throated Sparrow exhibits several notable traits:
