The White-browed Crake (Porzana cinerea) is native to a widespread range, found in various regions across Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Australasia. Its habitat includes wetlands, marshes, and grassy areas, where it can be observed foraging for food and navigating through dense vegetation.

Characteristics:
1. **Subdued Plumage:** The White-browed Crake displays subdued plumage, with a combination of brown and gray tones that provide effective camouflage in its preferred marshy habitats. This cryptic coloration helps the bird avoid detection by potential predators.

2. **Prominent White Eyebrows:** As the name suggests, the White-browed Crake is characterized by distinct white eyebrows or lines above its eyes, adding a subtle contrast to its overall muted coloration.

3. **Skulking Behavior:** This crake is known for its skulking behavior, preferring to stay hidden in dense vegetation. Its elusive nature and ability to navigate through thick cover make it challenging to spot despite its presence in suitable habitats.

4. **Omnivorous Diet:** White-browed Crakes have an omnivorous diet, feeding on a variety of foods including small invertebrates, seeds, and aquatic plants. Their foraging behavior often involves probing and picking at the ground in search of insects and other prey.

5. **Distinctive Vocalizations:** While generally secretive, the White-browed Crake is known for its distinctive vocalizations, which include a series of sharp and repetitive calls. These calls play a role in communication between individuals, especially during the breeding season, and may help establish territories within their habitat.
