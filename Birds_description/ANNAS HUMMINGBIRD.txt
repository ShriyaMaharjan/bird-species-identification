Origin:

The Anna's Hummingbird, scientifically known as Calypte anna, is a charismatic hummingbird species native to the western coast of North America, ranging from southern Alaska to northern Baja California in Mexico. These birds inhabit a variety of habitats, including coastal scrublands, gardens, parks, and chaparral, where they can be observed darting among flowers while feeding on nectar and small insects. Named after Anna Mass√©na, Duchess of Rivoli, this species has adapted well to urban environments and is a common sight in backyard gardens and urban green spaces.

Characteristics:

1. Iridescent Plumage: Anna's Hummingbirds exhibit striking iridescent plumage, particularly among males, with shimmering shades of green, red, and purple visible on their throat (gorget) and head, which can appear black in certain lighting conditions.
2. Hovering Flight: These birds are renowned for their exceptional flying abilities, including the ability to hover in mid-air while feeding, achieved through rapid wingbeats and precise aerial maneuvers facilitated by specialized shoulder joints.
3. Vocalizations: Anna's Hummingbirds produce a variety of vocalizations, including chirps, whistles, and buzzy calls, used for communication, territory defense, and courtship displays, with males often engaging in elaborate aerial displays to attract mates.
4. Year-round Breeding: Unlike many other hummingbird species, Anna's Hummingbirds breed throughout the year, facilitated by their ability to maintain stable populations in temperate climates and urban environments, where flowering plants provide consistent food sources.
5. Thermoregulation: Anna's Hummingbirds exhibit unique thermoregulatory adaptations, including torpor, a state of reduced metabolic activity and body temperature, which allows them to conserve energy during cold nights or periods of food scarcity, enabling them to survive in a variety of environmental conditions.
