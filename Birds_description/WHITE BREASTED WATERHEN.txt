The White-breasted Waterhen (Amaurornis phoenicurus) is widely distributed across South and Southeast Asia, with its range extending from the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia, including countries like India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Indonesia. These waterhens inhabit various wetland habitats, such as marshes, ponds, and mangroves, where they forage for food and build nests in dense vegetation.

Characteristics:
1. **Distinctive Plumage:** The White-breasted Waterhen is characterized by its distinctive plumage, featuring a white breast and underparts, contrasting with the dark brown or black upperparts. This coloration provides effective camouflage in the dense vegetation where they often reside.

2. **Long Legs and Toes:** Adapted for their semi-aquatic lifestyle, White-breasted Waterhens have long legs and toes, which enable them to navigate through wetland environments and walk on floating vegetation. These features are advantageous for foraging and exploring their habitat.

3. **Loud and Repeated Calls:** These waterhens are known for their loud and repeated calls, often described as harsh and cackling. Their vocalizations serve various purposes, including territory establishment, communication between mates, and warning calls in response to potential threats.

4. **Omnivorous Diet:** White-breasted Waterhens have an omnivorous diet, feeding on a variety of foods such as insects, small fish, amphibians, and vegetation. Their adaptability to diverse food sources contributes to their successful colonization of different wetland ecosystems.

5. **Solitary and Territorial Behavior:** While they may be observed in pairs or family groups during the breeding season, White-breasted Waterhens often exhibit solitary and territorial behavior. They fiercely defend their territories and may engage in aggressive interactions with neighboring individuals, particularly during the nesting period.
