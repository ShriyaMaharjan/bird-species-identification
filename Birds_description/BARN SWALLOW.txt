The Barn Swallow, scientifically known as Hirundo rustica, is a migratory bird species belonging to the Hirundinidae family. Originating from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas, these birds are found in a wide range of habitats, including open fields, meadows, marshes, and agricultural areas. Barn Swallows are known for their distinctive appearance, with long, pointed wings, deeply forked tails, and striking blue-black plumage on their upperparts and reddish-brown underparts.

1. Plumage: Barn Swallows exhibit striking blue-black plumage on their upperparts, complemented by reddish-brown underparts, along with a deeply forked tail, which is characteristic of the species.
2. Habitat: These birds are widespread across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas, where they inhabit a variety of open habitats, including fields, meadows, marshes, and agricultural areas.
3. Migratory Behavior: Barn Swallows are highly migratory birds, undertaking long-distance migrations between their breeding and wintering grounds in different hemispheres, covering thousands of miles each year.
4. Feeding Habits: They primarily feed on flying insects, including flies, mosquitoes, and beetles, which they catch on the wing using their agile flight and sharp beaks.
5. Nesting Behavior: Barn Swallows construct cup-shaped nests made of mud and plant fibers, which they attach to vertical surfaces, such as cliffs, buildings, or bridges. They often return to the same nesting sites year after year, adding new layers to their nests each breeding season.
