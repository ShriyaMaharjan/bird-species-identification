The Violet-green Swallow (Tachycineta thalassina) is a native bird species found in North America, with its range extending from Alaska to Mexico. These swallows inhabit various environments, including open woodlands, mountainous areas, and coastal regions, where they are known for their agile flight and distinct plumage.

Characteristics:
1. **Distinctive Plumage:** Violet-green Swallows display a striking combination of violet and green hues on their upperparts, with white underparts. Their namesake colors create a vibrant and eye-catching appearance, making them easily identifiable in flight.

2. **Forked Tail:** A notable characteristic of these swallows is their deeply forked tail. The tail's distinctive shape enhances their maneuverability during flight, allowing for swift and precise aerial movements as they catch insects on the wing.

3. **Cavity Nesters:** Violet-green Swallows are cavity-nesting birds, utilizing tree hollows, crevices, or man-made structures for nesting sites. They are known to nest in a variety of environments, including old woodpecker holes, natural tree cavities, and nest boxes.

4. **Insectivorous Diet:** Their diet primarily consists of insects, which they catch in flight using their specialized bills. Violet-green Swallows are skilled aerial foragers, darting through the air to capture flying insects, including mosquitoes, flies, and other small arthropods.

5. **Migratory Behavior:** These swallows are migratory birds, undertaking long-distance journeys between their breeding grounds in North America and wintering areas in Mexico and Central America. Their seasonal movements are influenced by the availability of insects and suitable nesting sites.
