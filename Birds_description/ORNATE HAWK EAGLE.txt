Origin:
The Oriental Bay Owl (Phodilus badius) is native to various countries in Southeast Asia, including India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This nocturnal bird species thrives in a range of forested habitats, from tropical and subtropical forests to wooded areas near rivers.

Characteristics:
1. **Distinctive Facial Disc:** The Oriental Bay Owl is recognized by its prominent facial disc, a characteristic feature common among many owl species. This facial disc helps in funneling sound to its ears, aiding in efficient sound localization during nighttime hunting.
2. **Reddish-Brown Plumage:** Adults typically exhibit a reddish-brown plumage, providing effective camouflage against the bark of trees where they roost during the day. This coloration aids in their concealment in the dense forest environment.
3. **Nocturnal Habits:** Being primarily nocturnal, Oriental Bay Owls are adapted to hunting in low light conditions. They use their keen sense of hearing to locate prey such as rodents, birds, and insects during the night.
4. **Facial Masking:** Some individuals of this species display a distinctive facial mask or dark markings around their eyes, contributing to their overall appearance and adding to their camouflage while perched.
5. **Tree-Cavity Nesting:** Oriental Bay Owls are cavity nesters, utilizing natural tree hollows or abandoned nests of other birds for breeding. This nesting behavior aligns with their forest habitat preference and contributes to their reproductive success in these environments.
