The Fairy Penguin, also known as the Little Penguin or Blue Penguin, originates from the coastal regions of Australia and New Zealand. These charming and petite penguins have adapted to a variety of environments, including rocky shores and sandy beaches, where they nest in burrows or under vegetation to avoid predators. 

As for their characteristics:
1. **Size:** Fairy Penguins are the smallest species of penguins, typically standing around 13 inches tall and weighing approximately 2 pounds.
2. **Coloration:** Their distinctive blue and white plumage provides excellent camouflage in the water, helping them avoid predators such as sea eagles and seals.
3. **Nocturnal Behavior:** Unlike many other penguin species, Fairy Penguins are primarily nocturnal, returning to their nests after dusk. This behavior helps them avoid predators that are active during the day.
4. **Social Structure:** These penguins form colonies for breeding and protection. They are known for their monogamous relationships, often returning to the same mate and nest site each breeding season.
5. **Unique Vocalizations:** Fairy Penguins communicate using a range of vocalizations, including braying sounds that help them locate their mate and chicks in crowded colonies.
