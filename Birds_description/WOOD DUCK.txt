The Wood Duck (Aix sponsa) is native to North America, with its range extending from southern Canada to the southeastern United States, and westward to the Pacific Northwest. These striking waterfowl inhabit various wetland environments, including lakes, ponds, rivers, and marshes, showcasing adaptability to both freshwater and forested habitats.

Characteristics:

Females, while more subtly colored, display elegant shades of brown and gray with distinctive eye markings.
