The Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) is a bird species native to North America, commonly found in a variety of aquatic habitats such as lakes, rivers, coastal waters, and estuaries. Recognizable by its distinctive appearance and remarkable fishing abilities, this cormorant species is widespread across the continent.

Characterized by unique features, the Double-crested Cormorant exhibits several key traits that contribute to its identity:

1. Size: A medium to large-sized bird, the Double-crested Cormorant typically measures between 70 to 90 centimeters in length, with a wingspan ranging from 114 to 123 centimeters.

2. Plumage: During the breeding season, adults display distinctive double crests of white feathers on their head, which gives the species its name. Outside the breeding season, these crests are less prominent. The overall plumage is dark brown or black, and the throat patch varies in color, turning yellow-orange during breeding.

3. Foraging Behavior: Double-crested Cormorants are skilled divers and swimmers. They forage underwater for fish, using their webbed feet to propel themselves. After fishing, they are often seen perched with wings spread open to dry, as their plumage is not fully waterproof.

4. Nesting Habits: These cormorants often nest in colonies, building their nests on elevated sites such as trees or cliffs. The nests are constructed with sticks and other materials and can be quite large.

5. Range: The Double-crested Cormorant has a broad distribution, found in a variety of freshwater and coastal environments throughout North America, from Canada to Mexico. They are adaptable birds that can thrive in both inland and marine habitats.

These characteristics collectively define the Double-crested Cormorant as a versatile and distinctive waterbird within North American ecosystems.
