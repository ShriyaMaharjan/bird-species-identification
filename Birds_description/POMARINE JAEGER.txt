The Pomarine Jaeger (Stercorarius pomarinus) is a seabird species with a circumpolar distribution in the Arctic and subarctic regions. These jaegers, also known as skuas, are well-adapted to a marine lifestyle and are often found in open ocean environments.

Characterized by specific traits, the Pomarine Jaeger exhibits several distinctive features:

1. **Circumpolar Distribution:** Pomarine Jaegers have a wide circumpolar distribution, with breeding grounds in the Arctic and subarctic regions, including North America, Europe, and Asia. During the non-breeding season, they migrate to more temperate waters.

2. **Large Size:** These jaegers are among the largest in their genus, with a wingspan ranging from 110 to 125 centimeters. Their robust build and powerful flight make them efficient predators in the marine environment.

3. **Pirate Behavior:** Pomarine Jaegers are known for their aggressive and opportunistic feeding behavior. They engage in piracy, often harassing and stealing food from other seabirds, forcing them to regurgitate their meals.

4. **Distinctive Plumage:** Adult Pomarine Jaegers have distinctive plumage, with dark brown to black upperparts and a contrasting white belly. They may also display a pale morph, featuring a lighter overall plumage.

5. **Long, Pointed Central Tail Feathers:** One of the defining characteristics is the elongated, pointed central tail feathers, or "spoons," which are more pronounced in adult birds during the breeding season. These tail feathers contribute to their aerodynamic efficiency during flight.

These characteristics collectively define the Pomarine Jaeger as a formidable and adaptable seabird species, well-suited to its life in the Arctic and subarctic marine environments.
