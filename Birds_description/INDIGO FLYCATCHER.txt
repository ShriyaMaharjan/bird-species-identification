Origin:
The Indigo Flycatcher (Eumyias indigo) is a species of bird found in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and parts of Indonesia. Inhabiting a variety of forested habitats, including subtropical and tropical forests, these small and vibrant flycatchers are known for their distinctive appearance and melodious calls.

Characteristics:
1. **Vivid Plumage:** Indigo Flycatchers are characterized by their striking indigo-blue plumage, which covers most of their body. The intense coloration of the males, in particular, makes them easily identifiable within their forested habitats.
2. **Dimorphic Coloration:** There is sexual dimorphism in the plumage of Indigo Flycatchers. While males exhibit the vibrant indigo-blue coloration, females have a more subdued appearance with predominantly olive-brown plumage, providing effective camouflage during nesting.
3. **Insectivorous Diet:** Indigo Flycatchers are primarily insectivores, feeding on a diet of small insects and other invertebrates. Their foraging behavior involves perching on branches and making short sallies to catch flying insects.
4. **Elevated Nesting Sites:** These flycatchers often build cup-shaped nests at elevated locations in trees, utilizing materials such as moss, lichen, and spider silk. The elevated nesting strategy helps protect their eggs and chicks from ground predators.
5. **Melodious Calls:** Indigo Flycatchers are known for their melodious and varied calls, including whistles, trills, and other vocalizations. These calls are often used for communication between individuals, establishing territory, and during courtship displays.
