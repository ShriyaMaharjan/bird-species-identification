Origin:
The Common House Martin (Delichon urbicum) is a bird species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. These agile aerial creatures are well-adapted to urban environments and are frequently observed nesting on man-made structures, such as buildings and bridges.

Characteristics:
1. **Distinctive Plumage:** Common House Martins are recognized by their sleek and uniform dark blue-black plumage on their upperparts, contrasting with a white underbelly.
2. **Forked Tail:** A prominent characteristic is their deeply forked tail, which aids in their agile and acrobatic flight as they catch insects on the wing.
3. **Nest-Building Behavior:** These birds exhibit remarkable nest-building skills, constructing cup-shaped nests using mud pellets and plant material. The nests are often attached to vertical surfaces, such as the sides of buildings.
4. **Migratory Behavior:** Common House Martins are migratory birds, undertaking long-distance journeys between their breeding grounds in the Northern Hemisphere and wintering areas in Africa.
5. **Insectivorous Diet:** With a diet primarily consisting of flying insects, Common House Martins are skilled aerial hunters, capturing their prey during swift and maneuverable flights.
