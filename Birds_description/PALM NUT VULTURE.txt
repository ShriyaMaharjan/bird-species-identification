Origin:
The Palm Nut Vulture (Gypohierax angolensis) is native to the tropical rainforests and mangrove swamps of sub-Saharan Africa. With a habitat spanning from Sierra Leone to Uganda and down to Angola, these vultures are particularly associated with regions rich in oil palm trees. Their presence in these lush environments reflects their specialized diet and ecological niche within the dense tropical landscapes.

Characteristics:
1. **Distinctive Plumage:** The Palm Nut Vulture exhibits striking plumage characterized by a contrasting black-and-white coloration. The black body feathers contrast with the white head and neck, creating a visually striking appearance.
2. **Bare Head and Face:** Unlike many other vulture species, the Palm Nut Vulture has a featherless head and face, adapted for scavenging on palm fruits without being hindered by messy plumage.
3. **Specialized Diet:** As the name suggests, these vultures have a unique dietary preference for palm fruits, which they consume with their powerful beaks and adapted digestive systems.
4. **Long, Broad Wings:** Adapted for soaring flight, Palm Nut Vultures possess long and broad wings, allowing them to cover large distances in search of food across their expansive tropical habitat.
5. **Distinct Vocalizations:** Palm Nut Vultures are known for their vocalizations, consisting of hissing and high-pitched calls. These sounds play a role in communication and possibly serve to establish territory within their rainforest habitat.
