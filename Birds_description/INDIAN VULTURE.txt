Origin:
The Indian Vulture (Gyps indicus) is native to the Indian subcontinent, inhabiting a range that extends across various countries, including India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. These vultures are commonly found in diverse habitats, from grasslands and savannas to urban areas, where they play a crucial ecological role as scavengers.

Characteristics:
1. **Raptor Adaptations:** Indian Vultures possess raptor characteristics, with strong, hooked beaks and sharp talons adapted for scavenging and feeding on carrion. Their strong beaks aid in tearing through tough hides and extracting meat from carcasses.
2. **Bald Head and Neck:** A notable feature of Indian Vultures is their bald head and neck, which minimizes the accumulation of blood and other fluids while feeding on carrion. This adaptation contributes to their hygiene and prevents contamination from pathogens.
3. **Scavenging Behavior:** Indian Vultures are obligate scavengers, relying primarily on carrion for their diet. They play a vital role in cleaning the environment by efficiently consuming carcasses, helping to prevent the spread of diseases in their ecosystems.
4. **Colonial Nesting:** These vultures exhibit colonial nesting behavior, often forming large colonies on cliffs or in tall trees for breeding. The social structure within colonies includes various interactions, such as courtship displays and territorial behaviors during the breeding season.
5. **Conservation Concerns:** Indian Vultures face significant conservation challenges, primarily due to the widespread use of the veterinary drug diclofenac, which is toxic to vultures. This has led to a drastic decline in their populations, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to mitigate threats and promote their recovery.
