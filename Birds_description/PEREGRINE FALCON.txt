Characteristics:
1. **Speed:** Peregrine Falcons are renowned for their extraordinary speed, reaching speeds of over 240 miles per hour (386 kilometers per hour) during a dive, making them the fastest birds in the world.
2. **Agility:** Possessing exceptional agility, Peregrines are adept at maneuvering in flight, enabling them to pursue and capture agile prey such as other birds mid-air.
3. **Distinctive Plumage:** These birds exhibit distinctive plumage, characterized by a dark crown, sharp facial markings, and a mottled underside. Their coloration provides effective camouflage in various habitats.
4. **Territorial Behavior:** Peregrine Falcons are territorial birds, defending their nesting sites against potential threats. They often choose high vantage points for nesting, such as cliffs or tall structures.
