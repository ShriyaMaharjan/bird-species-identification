The Double-eyed Fig Parrot (Cyclopsitta diophthalma) is a species of parrot native to the rainforests of northern and eastern Australia, as well as Papua New Guinea and surrounding islands. These vibrant and small-sized parrots are particularly associated with fig trees, where they feed on the fruits and play a crucial role in the ecosystem as seed dispersers.

Characterized by unique features, the Double-eyed Fig Parrot exhibits several key traits that contribute to its identity:

1. Size: This parrot species is relatively small, with adults typically measuring around 15 to 17 centimeters in length.

2. Plumage: The Double-eyed Fig Parrot is known for its striking and colorful plumage. It typically has a predominantly green body with vibrant red markings on the head, a distinctive black eye patch around each eye, and blue markings on the wings.

3. Diet: As the name suggests, figs are a significant part of the Double-eyed Fig Parrot's diet. They feed on a variety of fruits, including figs, as well as other plant materials such as flowers and nectar.

4. Behavior: These parrots are generally social and often observed in pairs or small groups. They are agile fliers and can navigate through the dense foliage of the rainforest with ease.

5. Habitat: Double-eyed Fig Parrots inhabit the dense canopies of rainforests, particularly favoring areas where fig trees are abundant. They are adapted to the intricate and varied ecosystems of tropical and subtropical rainforests.

These characteristics collectively define the Double-eyed Fig Parrot as a colorful and ecologically significant species within the avian biodiversity of Australia and the surrounding regions.
