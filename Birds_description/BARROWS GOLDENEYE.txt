The Barrow's Goldeneye, scientifically known as Bucephala islandica, is a species of diving duck native to North America. These birds are primarily found in regions such as western Canada, Alaska, and parts of the northwestern United States. Barrow's Goldeneyes inhabit freshwater lakes, rivers, and coastal habitats, where they dive underwater to forage for aquatic invertebrates, fish, and plant matter. They are characterized by their striking appearance, with males displaying glossy black plumage, white cheek patches, and a distinctive iridescent green head, while females have a more subdued brown plumage.

1. Plumage: Barrow's Goldeneyes exhibit striking plumage, with males displaying glossy black plumage, white cheek patches, and an iridescent green head, while females have a more subdued brown plumage with white patches around the eyes.
