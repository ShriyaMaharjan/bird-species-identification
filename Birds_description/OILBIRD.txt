Origin:
The Ostrich (Struthio camelus) is native to the vast grasslands, savannas, and open regions of Africa, spanning from Ethiopia and Somalia in the east to Senegal and Mauritania in the west. These flightless birds are well-adapted to a range of arid and semi-arid environments, with populations also found in South Africa and Namibia.

Characteristics:
1. **Flightless:** Ostriches are the largest and heaviest birds globally, and notably, they are flightless. Their large size, long legs, and inability to fly are compensated by their exceptional running speed, making them one of the fastest land animals.
2. **Powerful Legs:** Adapted for running, Ostriches have powerful and muscular legs equipped with only two toes. Their strong legs enable them to achieve speeds of up to 72 miles per hour (115 kilometers per hour) during sprints.
3. **Distinctive Plumage:** Adult male Ostriches exhibit striking black and white plumage, while females and young birds have a more brownish-gray coloration. The contrast in their plumage serves both as a visual display and for camouflage purposes in their natural habitats.
4. **Large Eyes:** Ostriches have large eyes, contributing to their keen eyesight. This adaptation is crucial for detecting predators in their open habitats, allowing them to react quickly to potential threats.
5. **Omnivorous Diet:** Ostriches are omnivores with a diverse diet that includes seeds, plants, insects, and small vertebrates. Their ability to consume a wide range of food sources contributes to their adaptability to various environments across Africa.
