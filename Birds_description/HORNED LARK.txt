Origin:
The Horned Lark (Eremophila alpestris) finds its origins in the open habitats of North America, spanning across various regions including grasslands, prairies, agricultural fields, and tundra. It is a highly adaptable bird, capable of thriving in diverse environments ranging from coastal plains to alpine meadows. The species is known for its distinctive black "horns" or feather tufts on the head, which contribute to its name. Horned Larks are widely distributed across their range and can be found year-round in many areas, while some populations undertake seasonal migrations.

Characteristics:
1. Plumage: The Horned Lark displays subtle yet striking plumage, characterized by a mix of brown, gray, and white tones, with black markings on the face and breast. During breeding season, males may develop black "horns" on their head, adding to their distinctive appearance.
2. Size: It is a relatively small bird, measuring around 15 to 18 centimeters (6 to 7 inches) in length, with a wingspan of approximately 30 to 35 centimeters (12 to 14 inches).
3. Vocalization: This species is known for its melodious song, often delivered from a prominent perch or during aerial displays. Their calls vary depending on context, including territorial defense, courtship, and communication within flocks.
4. Diet: Horned Larks are primarily granivorous, feeding on seeds and grains found in open habitats. They also consume a variety of insects, particularly during the breeding season when protein-rich food is essential for raising offspring.
5. Behavior: Highly social outside of the breeding season, Horned Larks often form large flocks, especially during migration and winter months. They are ground foragers, frequently seen running or hopping while foraging for food in open areas, utilizing their cryptic plumage for camouflage.
