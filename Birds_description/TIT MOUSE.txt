The Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor) is native to North America, primarily found in eastern regions of the United States and parts of Mexico. These small songbirds are adaptable to various wooded habitats, including deciduous and mixed forests, as well as suburban areas.

Characteristics:
1. **Distinctive Crest:** The Tufted Titmouse is recognized for its prominent black tuft or crest on the top of its head. This crest can be raised or lowered, adding to the bird's expressive features.

2. **Gray Plumage:** Titmice have predominantly gray plumage on their upperparts and wings, with paler underparts. This coloration aids in camouflage within the foliage of trees and shrubs.

3. **Social Behavior:** Tufted Titmice are highly social birds and are often seen in small flocks or family groups. They exhibit cooperative behaviors, such as foraging together and participating in communal roosting during the colder months.

4. **Insectivorous Diet:** Titmice primarily feed on insects, spiders, and small arthropods. They are agile foragers, gleaning prey from tree branches and leaves, and may also visit bird feeders for seeds, particularly during the winter months when insect availability is reduced.

5. **Nesting Habits:** These birds construct nests in tree cavities or abandoned woodpecker holes. They line their nests with softer materials such as fur, feathers, or moss. Titmice often choose secluded locations for nesting to protect their eggs and chicks from predators.
