The Scarlet Tanager (Piranga olivacea) is a songbird native to North and South America, with its breeding range extending from eastern North America to the Andes Mountains in South America. During the breeding season, these colorful tanagers inhabit deciduous and mixed woodlands, showcasing specific characteristics that contribute to their identity within the avian landscape.

Characterized by traits that define their appearance and behavior, the Scarlet Tanager exhibits the following features:

1. **North and South American Range:** Scarlet Tanagers have a broad distribution, breeding in eastern North America and migrating to wintering grounds in northwestern South America. Their migratory behavior takes them across extensive landscapes, from the cool forests of North America to the tropical regions of the Andes.

2. **Striking Breeding Plumage:** Adult male Scarlet Tanagers display striking breeding plumage, characterized by brilliant scarlet red feathers with contrasting black wings and tail. Females and non-breeding males, on the other hand, have olive-yellow plumage, providing effective camouflage in the foliage.

3. **Insectivorous Diet:** Scarlet Tanagers are primarily insectivores, foraging for a variety of insects, spiders, and caterpillars in the treetops. Their foraging behavior involves agile movements as they glean prey from leaves and branches.

4. **Nesting in Forest Canopies:** During the breeding season, Scarlet Tanagers build cup-shaped nests in the high branches of deciduous trees. The location of their nests in the forest canopy provides protection against predators and contributes to their secretive nesting behavior.

5. **Distinctive Song:** The Scarlet Tanager is known for its distinctive and melodious song, which consists of a series of musical phrases. The song serves various purposes, including territorial communication and mate attraction during the breeding season.
