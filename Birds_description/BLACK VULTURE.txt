Origin:
The Black Vulture, scientifically known as Coragyps atratus, is native to the Americas, with its range extending from the southern United States down through Central and South America. These adaptable birds are commonly found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and urban areas. Black Vultures are known for their soaring flight and scavenging behavior, often congregating near carrion and waste.

Characteristics:
1. **Appearance:** Adult Black Vultures have predominantly black plumage with a featherless, wrinkled black head. Their wingspan can reach up to 1.7 meters (5.6 feet), showcasing a distinctive contrast between the black feathers and the white tips of the wings.
2. **Feeding Habits:** Black Vultures are scavengers and primarily feed on carrion. They have a remarkable ability to locate food using their keen eyesight while soaring in the sky. They often gather in groups, known as a wake, around carcasses.
3. **Social Behavior:** These vultures exhibit social behavior, and roosting and feeding often occur in large groups. They are known for their communal dynamics and are frequently observed interacting with one another.
4. **Nesting:** Black Vultures typically build their nests on the ground, in caves, or in other sheltered locations. They do not construct elaborate nests but may use materials like twigs, leaves, or debris to create a simple structure.
5. **Range and Habitat:** The Black Vulture is versatile in its habitat preferences, being found in both natural landscapes and urban environments. They have adapted well to living in proximity to human activities, often scavenging around landfills and urban areas for food.
