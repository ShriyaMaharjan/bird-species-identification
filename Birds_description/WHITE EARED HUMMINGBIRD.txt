The White-eared Hummingbird (Hylocharis leucotis) is native to western Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. Its range includes regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, with populations extending into central Mexico. These hummingbirds favor arid and semi-arid habitats, including mountainous areas with flowering vegetation.

Characteristics:
1. **Distinctive Plumage:** The White-eared Hummingbird is characterized by its vibrant and contrasting plumage. Males exhibit iridescent green feathers on their upperparts, a white patch behind the eye (from which the bird derives its name), and a metallic blue throat. Females have a more muted coloration.

2. **Hovering Flight:** Like all hummingbirds, the White-eared Hummingbird possesses the ability to hover in mid-air. This capability is facilitated by their rapid wing beats, allowing them to feed on nectar from flowers with precision.

3. **Specialized Feeding:** With long, slender bills and specialized tongues adapted for extracting nectar from flowers, these hummingbirds primarily feed on floral nectar. They play a vital role in pollination as they move from one flower to another in search of food.

4. **Aggressive Territorial Behavior:** White-eared Hummingbirds are known for their territorial behavior, fiercely defending feeding territories against intruders. They engage in aerial chases and displays to establish dominance over their chosen foraging areas.

5. **Migration Patterns:** While some populations of White-eared Hummingbirds are year-round residents in their habitats, others undertake seasonal migrations. They may move to lower elevations during the winter months, especially in response to changing resource availability and temperature variations in their breeding areas.
