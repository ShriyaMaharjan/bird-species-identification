Origin:
The Ivory Gull (Pagophila eburnea) is a circumpolar bird species found in the Arctic regions, including the high Arctic islands of North America, Europe, and Asia. Its range extends to the northernmost parts of the globe, and it is often associated with sea ice and polar environments.

Characteristics:
1. **Distinctive Plumage:** The Ivory Gull is characterized by its pristine white plumage, providing effective camouflage against the snowy landscapes of its Arctic habitat. Its all-white appearance, including the bill and legs, sets it apart from other gull species.
2. **Compact Size:** These gulls are relatively small, with a wingspan of around 85 to 95 centimeters (33 to 37 inches) and a length of about 43 to 46 centimeters (17 to 18 inches). Their compact size enhances their agility in flight and maneuverability in icy environments.
3. **Pelagic Lifestyle:** Ivory Gulls are adapted to a pelagic lifestyle, often foraging over pack ice and open water. They are skilled flyers and can cover vast distances in their search for food, which mainly consists of fish, invertebrates, and scavenged carrion.
4. **Bold and Curious Behavior:** Known for their bold and curious behavior, Ivory Gulls may approach humans closely, displaying little fear. This behavior is believed to be a result of their isolation from land predators in their harsh Arctic environment.
5. **Vulnerability and Conservation Concerns:** The Ivory Gull is considered a vulnerable species due to various threats, including climate change, which affects sea ice dynamics, and environmental contaminants. Monitoring and conservation efforts are crucial to ensure the survival of this Arctic-adapted bird in a rapidly changing polar environment.
