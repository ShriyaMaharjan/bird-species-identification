The Tricolored Blackbird (Agelaius tricolor) is native to North America, with its range extending from the western United States into Mexico. These blackbirds primarily inhabit freshwater marshes, agricultural fields, and grasslands, making their home in areas with suitable nesting sites.

Characteristics:
1. **Distinctive Plumage:** Tricolored Blackbirds exhibit a unique and distinctive coloration. Males feature glossy black plumage with striking red shoulder patches, while females have more subdued brownish tones, creating a notable sexual dimorphism.

2. **Colonial Nesters:** Tricolored Blackbirds are colonial nesters, often forming large and densely packed colonies during the breeding season. These colonies provide protection against predators and facilitate communal defense of nesting sites.

3. **Endangered Status:** Unfortunately, the Tricolored Blackbird is listed as a species of concern and is considered near-threatened due to habitat loss and degradation. The conversion of wetlands to agriculture has significantly impacted their breeding and foraging habitats.

4. **Vocalizations:** Tricolored Blackbirds are known for their varied and complex vocalizations. The males produce a series of harsh and guttural calls, while females have softer calls. Vocalizations play a crucial role in communication within the colony.

5. **Nomadic Behavior:** Outside the breeding season, Tricolored Blackbirds exhibit nomadic behavior, moving across various habitats in search of food resources. Their nomadic tendencies contribute to their adaptability to different environments within their range.
