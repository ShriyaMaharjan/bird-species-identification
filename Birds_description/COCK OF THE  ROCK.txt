Origin:
The Andean Cock-of-the-Rock (Rupicola peruvianus), commonly known as the Cock-of-the-Rock, is a bird species native to South America, specifically found in the Andean cloud forests and subtropical rainforests. It inhabits the montane regions of countries like Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela.

Characteristics:
1. **Vibrant Plumage:** Male Cock-of-the-Rocks are renowned for their vibrant and flamboyant plumage, displaying a striking combination of bright orange, red, and black feathers. Females, however, have more subdued brownish plumage for better camouflage.
2. **Crested Head:** The males feature a distinctively large, fan-shaped crest on their heads, contributing to their unique appearance and courtship displays.
3. **Lekking Behavior:** During the breeding season, males gather in groups known as leks, where they perform elaborate courtship displays to attract females. These displays involve vocalizations, wing spreading, and showcasing their colorful plumage.
4. **Fruit Diet:** Cock-of-the-Rocks primarily feed on fruits, but they also consume insects and small vertebrates. Their strong, hooked bills are adapted for handling a variety of food items.
5. **Nesting Habits:** These birds construct bowl-shaped nests on cliff ledges or in tree hollows, providing a safe environment for raising their chicks. The nesting sites are carefully selected to offer protection from predators and the elements.
