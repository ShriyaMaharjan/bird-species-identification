Origin:
The Northern Parula (Setophaga americana) is a migratory songbird native to North America. Its breeding range extends from the northern parts of the United States, including the northeastern states and the Great Lakes region, into parts of Canada, primarily in the boreal forests. During the non-breeding season, these birds migrate to southern regions of the United States, Mexico, and Central America.

Characteristics:
1. **Vibrant Plumage:** The Northern Parula is known for its vibrant and distinctive plumage, featuring shades of blue-gray on the upperparts, a yellow-greenish back, and a bright yellow throat and breast.
2. **Eye Ring and Wing Bars:** Notable field marks include a white eye ring, enhancing its facial features, and two white wing bars on each wing, adding to the bird's overall striking appearance.
3. **Small Size:** With a petite size, the Northern Parula measures around 10 centimeters (4 inches) in length, making it one of the smaller warbler species. Its diminutive stature allows it to navigate through the dense foliage of its preferred habitats.
4. **Canopy Dwelling:** These warblers are often found in the canopy of deciduous and mixed forests, where they forage for insects. They are particularly associated with moss-laden trees and cypress swamps.
5. **Distinctive Song:** The Northern Parula is known for its high-pitched and complex song, resembling a buzzy trill. This melodious song contributes to its presence in the springtime breeding season and aids in communication within their forested habitats.
