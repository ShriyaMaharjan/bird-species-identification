The Crimson Chat (Epthianura tricolor) is a bird species endemic to Australia, predominantly found in arid and semi-arid regions across the continent. This small and colorful bird is well-adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.

1. **Size:** The Crimson Chat is a relatively small bird, with adults typically measuring around 12 to 14 centimeters in length.
