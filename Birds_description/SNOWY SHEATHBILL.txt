The Snowy Sheathbill (Chionis alba) is a bird species native to the Antarctic region and sub-Antarctic islands, including parts of South America, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. As one of the only two species of sheathbills, the Snowy Sheathbill is well-adapted to the extreme cold and challenging environments of the Southern Hemisphere.

Characterized by specific traits that define its identity within its polar habitat, the Snowy Sheathbill exhibits the following features:

1. **Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic Distribution:** The Snowy Sheathbill is primarily found in the Antarctic region, where it inhabits the coastal areas and islands surrounding the continent. Its range extends to sub-Antarctic regions, including the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, and the South Orkney Islands.

2. **All-White Plumage:** Adult Snowy Sheathbills display distinctive all-white plumage, providing effective camouflage against the snowy landscapes of the Antarctic. This adaptation helps them blend into their surroundings while foraging for food.

3. **Piscivorous Diet:** Unlike many other seabirds, Snowy Sheathbills are opportunistic feeders with a varied diet that includes fish, squid, krill, bird eggs, and carrion. Their ability to consume a diverse range of food sources contributes to their survival in harsh polar environments.

4. **Nesting Behavior:** Snowy Sheathbills exhibit ground-nesting behavior, often selecting rocky or gravelly sites for their nests. The nests are simple scrapes in the ground, and breeding pairs may use pebbles or other available materials to line the nest.

5. **Aggressive Interactions:** Snowy Sheathbills are known for their aggressive interactions with other seabirds, often scavenging for food and engaging in confrontations with nesting seabirds. Their opportunistic feeding habits and bold behavior contribute to their ecological role in the Antarctic ecosystem.
