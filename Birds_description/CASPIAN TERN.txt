Origin:
The Caspian Tern (Hydroprogne caspia) is a large seabird species with a global distribution. Found on every continent except Antarctica, Caspian Terns breed in diverse habitats such as coastal areas, islands, and inland wetlands, extending from North America and Europe to Asia, Africa, and Australia.

Characteristics:
1. **Large Size:** Caspian Terns are among the largest tern species, with a wingspan that can reach up to 4 feet (1.2 meters). Their impressive size contributes to their powerful and efficient flight over open waters.
2. **Black Cap:** During the breeding season, adult Caspian Terns exhibit a distinctive black cap on their heads, which contrasts with their white plumage. Outside the breeding season, the cap becomes less prominent.
3. **Long, Orange Bill:** A notable characteristic is their long and robust orange bill, which is slightly curved at the tip. This specialized bill is adapted for catching fish, their primary source of food.
4. **Loud Calls:** Caspian Terns are known for their loud and harsh calls, which they use for communication within their colonies and during their fishing expeditions. The calls can be heard from a considerable distance.
5. **Dive Feeding:** These terns employ a distinctive feeding technique known as plunge diving. They hover high above the water and then dive headfirst to catch fish with their sharp bills, demonstrating remarkable agility in flight and precision in hunting.
