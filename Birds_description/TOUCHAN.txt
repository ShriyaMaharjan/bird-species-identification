I'm sorry, but it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a typo in the term "TOUCHAN." It doesn't correspond to any known bird species in my training data up to my knowledge cutoff date in January 2022. If you have a correct or alternative name for the bird you are referring to, or if there's additional context or details you can provide, I would be happy to help you with information on the specific bird species you have in mind.
