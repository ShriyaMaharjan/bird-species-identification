The Black Francolin, scientifically known as Francolinus francolinus, is a species of bird belonging to the Phasianidae family. Originating from South Asia, particularly regions such as India, Pakistan, and Nepal, these ground-dwelling birds inhabit various habitats, including grasslands, scrublands, and agricultural areas. They are characterized by their mottled black and brown plumage, which provides camouflage in their preferred habitats. Black Francolins are known for their distinctive calls, particularly during the breeding season, when males produce loud and repetitive calls to establish territories and attract mates. They primarily feed on a diet consisting of seeds, grains, insects, and small invertebrates found on the ground.
