The Black Skimmer, scientifically known as Rynchops niger, is a seabird species belonging to the family Laridae. These distinctive birds are primarily found along the coasts of North and South America, inhabiting sandy beaches, estuaries, and coastal lagoons. They are known for their unique feeding behavior, characterized by flying low over the water with their lower mandible submerged to catch small fish. Black Skimmers have a striking appearance with black upperparts, white underparts, and a distinctive orange-red bill with a black tip, which is longer in males than in females.
