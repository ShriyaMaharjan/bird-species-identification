The Bufflehead (Bucephala albeola) is a small diving duck species native to North America, particularly found in freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, rivers, and coastal estuaries. These ducks are known for their distinctive appearance and behaviors, and their range spans from Alaska and Canada to parts of the United States.

Characterized by distinct features, the Bufflehead exhibits several notable traits:

1. **Compact Size:** Buffleheads are relatively small ducks, with adult males measuring around 13 to 15 inches (33 to 38 centimeters) in length. Their diminutive size contributes to their agility in the water and in-flight.

2. **Bold Plumage:** Adult male Buffleheads have striking black and white plumage, with a glossy greenish-black head, white sides, and a conspicuous white patch on the back of their heads. Females, while less colorful, exhibit a more subtle pattern of brown and white.

3. **Diving Behavior:** Buffleheads are skilled divers, capable of diving underwater to feed on aquatic invertebrates, small fish, and plant matter. Their diving ability allows them to forage efficiently in a variety of aquatic environments.

4. **Fast and Agile Flight:** These ducks are known for their fast and agile flight. They often fly close to the water's surface with rapid wingbeats, and their small size and maneuverability make them adept at navigating through dense vegetation.

5. **Northern Breeding Range:** Buffleheads are northern breeders, nesting in tree cavities or nest boxes in boreal and subarctic regions. They migrate to wintering grounds along coastal and inland waters, where they can be found in more temperate climates.

These characteristics highlight the Bufflehead's adaptations to both terrestrial and aquatic environments, emphasizing their distinctive plumage, diving prowess, and migratory patterns in North American habitats.
