Origin:
The Orange-breasted Bunting (Passerina leclancherii) is native to the eastern Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. Its range includes countries such as Nepal, Bhutan, northeastern India, Myanmar, and northern Thailand. Inhabiting grassy and shrubby areas in mountainous regions, these buntings are known for their vibrant plumage and seasonal movements within their native range.

Characteristics:
1. **Distinctive Male Plumage:** Adult males of the Orange-breasted Bunting showcase a striking combination of bright orange or reddish-orange plumage on their breast and throat, contrasting with their blue or bluish-black wings and upperparts.
2. **Females and Juveniles:** Females and juveniles, in contrast to males, have more subdued and cryptic plumage, featuring a combination of brown, olive, and gray tones, providing effective camouflage in their grassy habitats.
3. **Seasonal Migration:** Orange-breasted Buntings are known for their seasonal migrations, moving to different elevations in response to changes in temperature and food availability. These migrations contribute to their adaptability in dynamic mountainous environments.
4. **Grassland Habitat:** The buntings prefer grassy and shrubby habitats, including grasslands, meadows, and slopes, where they forage for seeds and insects on the ground and in low vegetation.
5. **Social Behavior:** These buntings often exhibit social behavior, with individuals forming loose flocks during the non-breeding season. During the breeding season, males establish territories and engage in courtship displays to attract mates.
