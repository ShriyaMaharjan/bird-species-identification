Origin:

The African Emerald Cuckoo, scientifically known as Chrysococcyx cupreus, is a species of cuckoo native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is found in various habitats including forests, woodlands, savannas, and riverine areas, across much of West, Central, and East Africa. African Emerald Cuckoos are migratory birds, with populations moving seasonally in response to changes in food availability and breeding conditions. They are known for their striking emerald-green plumage and distinctive calls, which contribute to their charm and allure.

Characteristics:

1. Size: African Emerald Cuckoos are relatively small birds, with adults typically measuring around 18 to 20 centimeters (7 to 8 inches) in length, with a wingspan of approximately 25 to 30 centimeters (10 to 12 inches). They have a slender body and long tail, with a curved bill adapted for catching insects.
2. Plumage: These cuckoos have iridescent emerald-green plumage on their upperparts, with contrasting white underparts. They have a distinctive black mask around their eyes and a black band across their chest. Their wings are adorned with white spots, and their tail feathers have white tips.
3. Vocalizations: African Emerald Cuckoos are known for their melodious calls, which consist of a series of whistles and trills. Their calls are typically heard during the breeding season and are used for communication within pairs, as well as territorial defense and courtship displays.
4. Feeding Behavior: These cuckoos are insectivorous birds, feeding primarily on a diet of insects and other small invertebrates. They forage by gleaning insects from foliage and branches, using their slender bills to pick off prey items from leaves and stems.
5. Breeding Habits: African Emerald Cuckoos are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other bird species, such as sunbirds and waxbills. They typically target small songbirds as hosts, choosing nests with suitable conditions for their eggs to hatch and their young to be raised. Once the cuckoo chick hatches, it will often eject the host's eggs or chicks from the nest to monopolize parental care.
