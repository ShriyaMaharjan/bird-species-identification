The Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Calidris pygmaea) is a migratory bird species with a breeding range in northeastern Russia and wintering grounds in various East Asian and Southeast Asian coastal areas. Facing significant threats to its population, this small wader is known for its distinctive spatula-shaped bill and is considered a critically endangered species.

Characterized by specific traits that define its identity within its migratory range, the Spoon-billed Sandpiper exhibits the following features:

1. **Breeding Range in Northeastern Russia:** The Spoon-billed Sandpiper breeds in the coastal tundra regions of northeastern Russia, particularly in Chukotka and Kamchatka. These remote areas serve as crucial breeding grounds for their survival.

2. **Migratory Behavior:** During the non-breeding season, Spoon-billed Sandpipers undertake long migrations to wintering grounds in East Asia and Southeast Asia. Key wintering sites include locations in China, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Thailand.

3. **Distinctive Spoon-shaped Bill:** Perhaps its most notable feature, the Spoon-billed Sandpiper has a unique bill with a distinctive spoon-shaped tip. This specialized bill allows it to sweep side to side, foraging efficiently for small invertebrates in the mud and sand.

4. **Dimorphic Plumage:** During the breeding season, males and females display dimorphic plumage. Males showcase a brighter, more colorful breeding attire, while females have a more subdued appearance. This dimorphism aids in courtship and reproductive behaviors.

5. **Critical Conservation Status:** The Spoon-billed Sandpiper faces severe threats to its population, primarily due to habitat loss along its migration route and degradation of its breeding grounds. Conservation efforts are underway to protect key habitats and address the challenges posed by changing environmental conditions.
