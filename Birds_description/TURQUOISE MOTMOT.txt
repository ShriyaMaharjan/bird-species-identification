The Turquoise-browed Motmot (Eumomota superciliosa), commonly known as the Turquoise Motmot, is native to Central America, with its range extending from southeastern Mexico to Costa Rica. Inhabiting both dry and humid forests, these striking birds are known for their vibrant plumage and distinctive tail feathers.

Characteristics:
1. **Turquoise Plumage:** The Turquoise Motmot is characterized by its vibrant turquoise and green plumage. The striking colors extend from the head to the upperparts, creating an eye-catching appearance. The turquoise crown and facial markings add to its distinctive look.

2. **Long Tail with Racket Tips:** One of the most unique features of the Turquoise Motmot is its long tail with distinctive racket-shaped tips. The central tail feathers are modified with bare shafts and tipped with elongated spatula-like structures, creating a racket-like appearance.

4. **Hollow Nesting Sites:** Turquoise Motmots typically nest in burrows, which they excavate in dirt or sand banks. The nesting sites are often located at the ends of tunnels, providing protection for their eggs and chicks. They may also use natural crevices or old termite nests.

5. **Distinctive Call:** The Turquoise Motmot is known for its distinctive call, which includes a series of hooting or clicking sounds. Their vocalizations serve various purposes, including communication within mated pairs and signaling territorial boundaries.
