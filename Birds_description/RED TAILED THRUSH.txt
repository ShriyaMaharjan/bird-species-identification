As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there is no widely recognized bird species known as the "Red-tailed Thrush." It's possible that new species have been identified or named since then, or there might be local or uncommon names for a specific bird. If you have more details or if the bird is known by another name, please provide additional information, and I'll do my best to assist you.
