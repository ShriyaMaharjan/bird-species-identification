The Black-necked Grebe, known scientifically as Podiceps nigricollis, is a species of aquatic bird belonging to the Podicipedidae family. Originating primarily from Eurasia and parts of Africa, these elegant birds inhabit freshwater lakes, marshes, and ponds during the breeding season. They are known for their striking black necks during breeding plumage, which contrast vividly with their white faces and reddish-golden ear tufts. Outside of the breeding season, their appearance becomes more subdued, with a darker brownish-gray plumage. Black-necked Grebes are skilled divers and primarily feed on aquatic invertebrates and small fish.
