Origin:
The Cinnamon Teal (Spatula cyanoptera) is a species of dabbling duck native to North and South America. Its range extends from the western United States and Canada down to Central and South America, including regions in Mexico, the Caribbean, and parts of South America such as Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. These ducks inhabit freshwater marshes, ponds, and lakes.

Characteristics:
1. **Cinnamon Plumage:** Cinnamon Teals are aptly named for their distinctive plumage, with males displaying striking cinnamon-colored feathers on their body, head, and neck during the breeding season.
2. **Blue Wing Patch:** A key characteristic is the bright blue patch on the wing, which is prominent during both the breeding and non-breeding seasons and aids in easy identification.
3. **Dabbling Behavior:** As dabbling ducks, Cinnamon Teals feed by tipping forward in the water, grazing on aquatic plants, seeds, and small invertebrates. Their feeding behavior is often observed in shallow waters.
4. **Sexual Dimorphism:** Male and female Cinnamon Teals exhibit sexual dimorphism, with females having more subdued plumage, featuring mottled brown tones, providing effective camouflage during nesting.
5. **Migratory Patterns:** While some populations of Cinnamon Teals are resident year-round in their habitats, others are migratory, undertaking seasonal movements to find suitable breeding and wintering grounds. This migratory behavior contributes to their adaptability across a range of wetland environments.
