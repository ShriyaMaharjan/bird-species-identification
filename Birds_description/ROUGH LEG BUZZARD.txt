The Rough-legged Buzzard (Buteo lagopus) is a bird of prey native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. During the breeding season, these buzzards inhabit tundra and taiga habitats, and they migrate south to more temperate regions during winter, often venturing into open country and farmland.

Characterized by specific traits, the Rough-legged Buzzard exhibits several distinctive features:

1. **Feathered Legs:** A notable characteristic is the presence of feathers covering the legs all the way down to the feet, an adaptation to the cold environments where they breed and hunt.

2. **Large Wingspan:** Rough-legged Buzzards have a relatively large wingspan, which aids in soaring and hovering over open landscapes as they search for prey. This feature is particularly useful during their winter migration.

3. **Dark Belly Band:** Adults typically have a dark belly band, a distinctive marking that contrasts with their lighter plumage. This band is more pronounced in females than in males.

4. **Rodent-Eating Behavior:** These buzzards primarily feed on small mammals, especially rodents. Their hunting strategy often involves hovering in the air before making a swooping dive to catch prey.

5. **Migratory Nature:** Rough-legged Buzzards are known for their extensive migratory journeys, covering large distances between their breeding and wintering grounds. Their migration patterns contribute to their widespread distribution.

These characteristics collectively define the Rough-legged Buzzard as a well-adapted raptor, specifically suited to the harsh conditions of the Arctic and subarctic regions during the breeding season and displaying impressive migratory behavior.
