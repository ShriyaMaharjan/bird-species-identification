Origin:
The Golden-cheeked Warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) is a small bird species endemic to Central Texas in the United States and is the only bird species with a breeding range confined to Texas. It primarily breeds in mature oak-juniper woodlands within the Edwards Plateau region, where it forages for insects and spiders among the foliage. The Golden-cheeked Warbler is a federally endangered species due to habitat loss and fragmentation caused by urbanization, agriculture, and land development.

Characteristics:
1. Plumage: The Golden-cheeked Warbler exhibits distinctive plumage characterized by vibrant golden-yellow cheeks and throat, contrasting with olive-green upperparts and white underparts. It also features black streaking on its sides and flanks.
2. Size: It is a small warbler, measuring around 4.5 to 5 inches (11 to 13 centimeters) in length, with a wingspan of approximately 7 to 8 inches (18 to 20 centimeters).
3. Vocalizations: Communicates with a series of high-pitched, buzzy songs consisting of repeated phrases, which are often heard during the breeding season as males establish territories and attract mates.
4. Habitat Preference: Prefers mature oak-juniper woodlands with a dense canopy and understory, where it can find suitable nesting sites and abundant insect prey for foraging.
5. Breeding Behavior: Constructs cup-shaped nests made of grasses, plant fibers, and spider silk, typically placed in the fork of tree branches. The female lays a clutch of eggs, and both parents share in the incubation of eggs and care for the young hatchlings until they fledge and become independent.
