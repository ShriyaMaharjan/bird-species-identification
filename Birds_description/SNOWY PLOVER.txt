The Snowy Owl (Bubo scandiacus) is a majestic bird of prey native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. Recognized for its distinctive appearance and adaptation to the harsh polar environment, the Snowy Owl plays a significant role in the ecosystems of the Arctic tundra.

Characterized by specific traits that define its identity within its vast and frigid habitat, the Snowy Owl exhibits the following features:

1. **Arctic and Subarctic Range:** Snowy Owls inhabit the Arctic and subarctic regions, with their breeding range extending across the tundra of North America and Eurasia. They are well-adapted to the extreme cold and open landscapes of these polar environments.

2. **Snowy Plumage:** As their name suggests, Snowy Owls have a predominantly white plumage that provides effective camouflage against the snowy backdrop of the Arctic. Males may have some dark barring, while females and young owls often display more extensive dark markings.

3. **Diurnal Hunting:** Unlike many owl species, Snowy Owls are known for their diurnal hunting behavior, especially during the extended daylight hours of the Arctic summer. They prey on a variety of small mammals, birds, and occasionally fish.

4. **Large Size:** Snowy Owls are among the largest owl species, with males typically being smaller than females. Their substantial size, powerful talons, and strong beak contribute to their efficiency as predators in the Arctic ecosystem.

5. **Nomadic Behavior:** Snowy Owls exhibit nomadic tendencies, with their movements influenced by the availability of prey. In certain years, when food sources are scarce in their breeding grounds, Snowy Owls may migrate southward in search of better hunting opportunities, leading to occasional sightings in more southerly regions.
