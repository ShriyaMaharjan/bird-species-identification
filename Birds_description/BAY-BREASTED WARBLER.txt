The Bay-breasted Warbler, scientifically known as Setophaga castanea, is a small passerine bird native to North America. These warblers breed in the boreal forests of Canada and Alaska, and during migration, they traverse through eastern North America to reach their wintering grounds in Central and South America. Bay-breasted Warblers inhabit various forested habitats, including coniferous and mixed forests, where they forage for insects and spiders among the foliage. They are known for their distinctive plumage during the breeding season, featuring a chestnut-colored patch on the sides, which contrasts with their olive-green upperparts and white underparts.
