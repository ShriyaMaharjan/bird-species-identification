The Violet-backed Starling (Cinnyricinclus leucogaster) is native to sub-Saharan Africa, with its range extending from Senegal and Gambia to Ethiopia, and southward to South Africa. Inhabiting a variety of habitats, including savannas, woodlands, and open grasslands, these starlings are known for their vibrant plumage and social behaviors.

Characteristics:
1. **Iridescent Plumage:** The Violet-backed Starling is characterized by its iridescent and multicolored plumage. Males exhibit vibrant violet, blue, and green feathers on their upperparts, while females have a more subdued coloration, often featuring shades of brown and green.

2. **White Abdomen:** Both males and females have a distinctive white abdomen, creating a stark contrast with their colorful upperparts. This feature contributes to their overall striking appearance and aids in identification.

3. **Migratory Behavior:** The Violet-backed Starling is a migratory bird, undertaking seasonal movements in response to changes in weather and resource availability. These migrations may lead them across extensive distances as they search for suitable breeding and feeding grounds.

4. **Social Flocking:** These starlings are highly social birds and are often observed in large flocks, especially during the non-breeding season. Their social nature extends to various activities, including foraging, roosting, and engaging in aerial displays.

5. **Nesting in Tree Cavities:** The Violet-backed Starling nests in tree cavities, using natural hollows or old woodpecker nests. They may also occupy man-made structures such as nest boxes. The female typically lays a clutch of eggs, and both parents contribute to incubation and caring for the chicks.
