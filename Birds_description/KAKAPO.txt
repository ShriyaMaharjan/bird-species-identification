Origin:
The Kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), also known as the night parrot or owl parrot, is a critically endangered and nocturnal parrot native to New Zealand. Historically widespread, the Kakapo has experienced a severe decline in population due to habitat loss, introduced predators, and low reproductive rates, resulting in its critically endangered status.

Characteristics:
1. **Nocturnal Behavior:** The Kakapo is primarily nocturnal, exhibiting heightened activity during the night. This behavior is believed to be an adaptation to avoid diurnal predators that were introduced to New Zealand, such as rats and stoats.
2. **Flightlessness:** The Kakapo is a large, flightless parrot, and it is the heaviest parrot species in the world. Its reduced ability to fly is compensated by strong legs, allowing it to climb trees and navigate its forested habitat.
3. **Herbivorous Diet:** Unlike many parrot species, the Kakapo is herbivorous, primarily feeding on native vegetation, seeds, fruits, and bark. This dietary specialization reflects its adaptation to the New Zealand forest ecosystem.
4. **Unusual Breeding System:** Kakapos have an unusual and infrequent breeding system known as "lek breeding." Males gather in specific locations to compete for the attention of females, engaging in elaborate displays and vocalizations to attract mates.
5. **Limited Geographic Range:** The Kakapo is endemic to New Zealand and historically inhabited both the North and South Islands. However, due to its critically endangered status, conservation efforts are focused on a few predator-free offshore islands to protect and increase its population.
