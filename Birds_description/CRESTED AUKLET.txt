The Crested Auklet (Aethia cristatella) is a seabird species native to the northern Pacific Ocean, particularly found in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific Ocean. These distinctive auks are known for their crested appearance and are associated with marine environments.

1. **Size:** Crested Auklets are relatively small seabirds, with adults typically measuring around 28 to 33 centimeters in length.

2. **Plumage:** Characterized by unique and striking features, these auks have dark-colored plumage with a distinct white facial plume extending from the eye and a forward-curving crest on the forehead. During the breeding season, their bill becomes brightly colored.

3. **Breeding Colonies:** Crested Auklets are colonial breeders, nesting in large colonies on remote islands. They often choose sites with rocky crevices or cliffs where they can create their burrows for nesting.

4. **Diet:** As marine foragers, Crested Auklets primarily feed on small fish and invertebrates. They are skilled divers, using their wings to propel themselves underwater in search of prey.

5. **Vocalizations:** These auks are known for their vocalizations, which include a variety of calls and whistles. Vocal communication is crucial within breeding colonies for pair bonding and territorial interactions.

These characteristics collectively define the Crested Auklet as a visually distinctive and ecologically adapted seabird species within the northern Pacific marine ecosystems.
