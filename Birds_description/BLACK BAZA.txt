The Black Baza, scientifically known as Aviceda leuphotes, is a species of bird of prey belonging to the Accipitridae family. Originating from South and Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam, these agile raptors inhabit various forested habitats, including tropical and subtropical forests, where they hunt for small birds and insects. Black Bazas are known for their striking black plumage with white and chestnut markings, as well as their distinctive hunting behavior, which often involves agile flight maneuvers to catch prey in mid-air.

1. Plumage: The Black Baza exhibits striking black plumage with contrasting white and chestnut markings on the underparts and wings, making it easily distinguishable in its forest habitat.
2. Habitat: These birds are native to South and Southeast Asia, where they primarily inhabit forested habitats, including tropical and subtropical forests, as well as wooded areas near water bodies.
3. Hunting Behavior: Black Bazas are adept hunters, often employing agile flight maneuvers to catch small birds and insects in mid-air, demonstrating remarkable agility and precision.
4. Breeding Habits: They typically breed during the dry season, constructing small nests in the canopy of trees using twigs and leaves, where they lay their eggs and raise their young.
5. Migration Patterns: While some populations are sedentary, others may undertake seasonal migrations in response to changing food availability and environmental conditions, particularly in regions with distinct wet and dry seasons.
