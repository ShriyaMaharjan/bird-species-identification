Origin:
The Golden Pipit (Tmetothylacus tennelus) is a species of bird native to sub-Saharan Africa, particularly found in grassland habitats across countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Ethiopia. It prefers open savannas, grassy plains, and agricultural fields with scattered bushes and shrubs, where it forages for insects and seeds on the ground. The Golden Pipit is known for its distinctive plumage and distinctive call, making it a sought-after sighting among birdwatchers in its range.

Characteristics:
1. Plumage: The Golden Pipit exhibits striking plumage characterized by golden-yellow underparts, contrasting with a dark brown back and wings. It has a distinctive black mask around its eyes and a white throat patch, adding to its overall appearance.
2. Size: It is a medium-sized bird, measuring around 7 to 8 inches (18 to 20 centimeters) in length, with a wingspan of approximately 12 to 13 inches (30 to 33 centimeters).
3. Foraging Behavior: The Golden Pipit primarily feeds on a diet of insects such as grasshoppers, beetles, and ants, as well as seeds and grains found on the ground. It forages by hopping and walking along the ground, occasionally making short flights to catch flying insects.
4. Vocalizations: Communicates with a series of melodious calls and whistles, which vary in pitch and intensity depending on the situation. Its vocalizations are often used for territorial defense and mate attraction.
5. Breeding Habits: Constructs cup-shaped nests made of grasses, roots, and other plant materials, typically placed in a shallow depression on the ground. Both parents share in the incubation of eggs and care for the young hatchlings until they fledge and become independent.
