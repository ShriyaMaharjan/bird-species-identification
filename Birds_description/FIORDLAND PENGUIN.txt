Origin:
The Fiordland Penguin (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus) is a species of crested penguin native to New Zealand, particularly in the southwestern parts of the South Island and some nearby offshore islands. These penguins are well-adapted to the rugged coastal environments and fiords, where they nest and forage. Fiordland Penguins are known for their distinctive appearance and behaviors, contributing to the rich biodiversity of New Zealand's marine ecosystems.

Characteristics:
1. **Crested Plumage:** Fiordland Penguins are characterized by distinctive yellow crests extending from above their eyes to the back of the head, providing a unique and recognizable feature among penguin species.
2. **Large Size:** Among the crested penguins, the Fiordland Penguin is one of the largest, with adults reaching notable sizes, contributing to their robust and sturdy appearance.
3. **Coastal Nesting Sites:** These penguins choose rocky coastal areas for nesting, often in densely vegetated locations, creating nests out of twigs, leaves, and other available materials to provide a secure environment for their eggs and chicks.
4. **Marine Foraging:** Fiordland Penguins are adept marine foragers, primarily feeding on fish, squid, and crustaceans, relying on their streamlined bodies and flipper-like wings for efficient underwater propulsion.
5. **Endemic to New Zealand:** The Fiordland Penguin is endemic to New Zealand, with a limited distribution along the southwestern coast of the South Island and nearby islands, highlighting its localized presence in the region's unique coastal ecosystems.
