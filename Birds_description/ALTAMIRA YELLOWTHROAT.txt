Origin:

The Altamira Yellowthroat, scientifically known as Geothlypis flavovelata, is a species of New World warbler native to Mexico and parts of Central America. These birds inhabit wetland areas such as marshes, mangroves, and freshwater swamps, where they forage for insects and other small invertebrates among dense vegetation. Altamira Yellowthroats are named after the Altamira region in Mexico, where they were first discovered, and are known for their distinctive yellow throats and olive-green plumage.

Characteristics:

1. Plumage: Altamira Yellowthroats have olive-green upperparts and yellow underparts, with a bright yellow throat and breast that contrasts with their darker head and back. They also have black markings on their face, including a black mask through the eye and a thin black line extending from the bill to the eye.
2. Habitat Preference: These birds are typically found in dense vegetation near water, including cattails, reeds, and other emergent plants in wetland habitats. They are well-adapted to navigating through dense vegetation and are often heard singing from concealed perches within the marsh.
3. Vocalizations: Altamira Yellowthroats produce a variety of vocalizations, including sharp "chip" notes and melodious, warbling songs. Their songs are often delivered from a hidden position within dense vegetation and may include trills, whistles, and musical phrases.
4. Foraging Behavior: Altamira Yellowthroats are primarily insectivorous, foraging for insects and other small invertebrates among the dense vegetation of their wetland habitats. They glean insects from leaves, stems, and branches or capture them in mid-air during brief flights.
5. Breeding Biology: Altamira Yellowthroats breed during the wet season, constructing cup-shaped nests made of plant fibers, grasses, and other materials hidden among the dense vegetation of wetland habitats. They lay clutches of eggs and both parents participate in incubating the eggs and raising the young.
