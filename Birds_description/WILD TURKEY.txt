The Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is a large bird native to North America. With a historical range extending from Mexico to southeastern Canada, these iconic birds have adapted to a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and open woodlands.

Characteristics:
1. **Large Size:** Wild Turkeys are sizable birds, with males, known as toms or gobblers, reaching an average weight of around 18 pounds and females, called hens, being somewhat smaller. Their robust build contributes to their ability to forage for a diverse range of foods.

2. **Distinctive Plumage:** Adult male Wild Turkeys boast iridescent plumage with a range of colors, including bronze, green, and copper. They also have a characteristic fleshy protuberance known as a "snood" hanging from their beak. Females have more muted brown and gray tones for better camouflage during nesting.

3. **Courtship Displays:** During the breeding season, male Wild Turkeys engage in elaborate courtship displays, which may include puffing out their feathers, spreading their tail feathers into a fan, and producing characteristic gobbling sounds. These displays are aimed at attracting females for mating.

4. **Omnivorous Diet:** Wild Turkeys are opportunistic omnivores, feeding on a variety of foods, including seeds, fruits, insects, and small vertebrates. Their adaptable diet allows them to thrive in diverse environments.

5. **Ground-Nesting Behavior:** Female Wild Turkeys construct nests on the ground, typically hidden in vegetation, where they lay a clutch of eggs. The ground-nesting behavior helps protect the eggs and chicks from predators, and the female takes on the responsibility of incubating the eggs and caring for the young poults after hatching.
