The Vermilion Flycatcher (Pyrocephalus rubinus) is native to the Americas, with its range extending from the southwestern United States through Central America to South America. Inhabiting a variety of open habitats, including grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands, these flycatchers are known for their vibrant plumage and distinctive behaviors.

Characteristics:
1. **Vivid Plumage:** Vermilion Flycatchers are characterized by their striking and vibrant plumage. Males exhibit brilliant vermilion or scarlet feathers, particularly on their crown, throat, and chest. Females, while less colorful, still display a mix of gray, white, and pale orange tones.

2. **Long Tail:** These flycatchers have a relatively long and slender tail, which adds to their overall graceful appearance. The tail may be used for balance during aerial maneuvers as they catch insects on the wing.

3. **Insectivorous Diet:** Vermilion Flycatchers are insectivores, and their diet primarily consists of flying insects. They are adept aerial hunters, capturing prey in mid-air with swift and agile flights from perches.

4. **Elaborate Courtship Displays:** During the breeding season, male Vermilion Flycatchers engage in elaborate courtship displays to attract females. These displays often involve fluttering flights, vocalizations, and showcasing their vibrant plumage to establish dominance and court potential mates.

5. **Widespread Distribution:** The Vermilion Flycatcher has a broad distribution, encompassing a variety of ecosystems from North to South America. This adaptability to different habitats contributes to the species' widespread presence across diverse landscapes.
