Origin:
The Chestnut-winged Cuckoo (Clamator coromandus) is a bird species native to parts of South and Southeast Asia. Its range includes countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. These cuckoos inhabit various forested habitats, including tropical and subtropical forests.

Characteristics:
1. **Distinctive Plumage:** The Chestnut-winged Cuckoo is characterized by its unique plumage, featuring a combination of black, chestnut, and white markings. The chestnut-colored wings and tail provide a striking contrast to the predominantly black body.
2. **Long-Tailed:** These cuckoos have a relatively long tail, which adds to their overall elegant appearance. The tail is often prominently displayed during flight.
3. **Brood Parasitism:** Like many cuckoo species, the Chestnut-winged Cuckoo is a brood parasite. It lays its eggs in the nests of other bird species, relying on host birds to raise their young.
4. **Insectivorous Diet:** Their diet primarily consists of insects, caterpillars, and other small invertebrates. They are skilled in catching prey on the wing or by gleaning from vegetation.
5. **Distinctive Calls:** Chestnut-winged Cuckoos are known for their distinctive and repetitive calls, often described as a series of loud and clear whistles. These vocalizations play a role in communication and territory establishment within their forested habitats.
