Origin:

The African Pied Hornbill, scientifically known as Tockus fasciatus, is a species of hornbill native to sub-Saharan Africa. These birds are found in a variety of habitats including savannas, woodlands, forests, and riverine areas, across much of eastern and southern Africa. African Pied Hornbills are arboreal birds that are often observed perched in trees and shrubs, where they forage for food and nest in natural tree cavities or abandoned nest holes.

Characteristics:

1. Size: African Pied Hornbills are medium-sized birds, measuring around 45 to 55 centimeters (18 to 22 inches) in length, with a wingspan of approximately 60 to 70 centimeters (24 to 28 inches). They have a stocky build with broad wings and a relatively large head compared to their body size.
2. Plumage: These hornbills have striking black and white plumage, with black upperparts and white underparts. They have a white belly, throat, and tail, with black wings, back, and head. The bill is long and curved, with a downward-pointing casque on top.
3. Casque: African Pied Hornbills have a distinctive casque on top of their bill, which is a hollow, bony structure covered with keratin. The casque varies in size and shape among individuals and is thought to play a role in visual and acoustic communication, as well as providing protection during head-first entries into tree cavities.
4. Foraging Behavior: These hornbills primarily feed on a diet of fruits, berries, insects, small reptiles, and amphibians. They forage in trees and shrubs, using their strong bills to pluck fruits and capture prey items from branches and foliage.
5. Breeding Habits: African Pied Hornbills are cavity-nesting birds that typically nest in natural tree hollows or abandoned nest holes excavated by woodpeckers or other birds. They lay a clutch of eggs in the nest cavity, and both parents take turns incubating the eggs and caring for the young until they fledge. Hornbill chicks are born naked and helpless and rely on their parents for food and protection.
