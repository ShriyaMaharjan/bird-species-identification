Origin:
The Greater Prairie Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido) is a bird native to the grasslands and prairies of North America. Historically, it inhabited vast expanses of grasslands stretching from Canada down to Texas and from the Rocky Mountains to the eastern woodlands. However, due to habitat loss and fragmentation, its range has significantly decreased. These birds are known for their elaborate courtship displays, which involve booming calls and dancing rituals performed on communal display grounds known as leks. Despite conservation efforts, the Greater Prairie Chicken remains a symbol of the disappearing native prairie ecosystem.

Characteristics:
1. Size: Adult males typically weigh between 2 to 3 pounds (0.9 to 1.4 kilograms), while females are slightly smaller.
2. Plumage: During the breeding season, males display vibrant orange air sacs on their necks, contrasting with their overall mottled brown and black plumage. Females have more subdued plumage for camouflage.
3. Courtship Displays: Males gather on leks, where they perform elaborate courtship displays involving booming calls and rapid foot-stomping to attract females.
4. Habitat Preference: Prefers open grasslands and prairies with scattered shrubs for nesting and cover, where it feeds on seeds, insects, and vegetation.
5. Conservation Status: Listed as a species of conservation concern due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and hunting pressure. Conservation efforts often involve habitat restoration and protection of lekking grounds.
