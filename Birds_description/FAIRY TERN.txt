The Fairy Tern, scientifically known as Sterna nereis, has its origins in tropical and subtropical coastal regions, commonly found on islands and along the coasts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. This graceful bird is recognized for its elegant flight patterns and distinctive appearance, with its white plumage and long, slender wings.

As for its characteristics:
1. **Size:** Fairy Terns are relatively small birds, with a wingspan of about 20 inches (50 centimeters) and an overall length of approximately 9-10 inches (23-25 centimeters).
2. **Feeding Habits:** These birds are skilled aerial hunters, feeding on small fish and invertebrates, which they catch by plunge-diving into the water from mid-air.
3. **Breeding Behavior:** Fairy Terns exhibit strong fidelity to breeding sites, often returning to the same locations year after year. They typically nest on sandy beaches or coastal flats.
4. **Distinctive Plumage:** The Fairy Tern is characterized by its pristine white plumage, a black cap on its head, and a narrow black line extending from its eyes to the back of its neck.
5. **Vocalizations:** While generally quiet, Fairy Terns engage in soft vocalizations, especially during the breeding season. These calls are often used for communication between mates and parents and their chicks.
