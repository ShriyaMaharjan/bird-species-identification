The Tawny Frogmouth (Podargus strigoides) is native to Australia, including both the mainland and Tasmania. This nocturnal bird is found in a variety of habitats, ranging from forests and woodlands to urban areas, where it relies on its exceptional camouflage to blend into tree branches during the day.

Characteristics:
1. **Camouflage Plumage:** Tawny Frogmouths have plumage that closely resembles the bark of trees, providing them with exceptional camouflage. This adaptation helps them remain inconspicuous during daylight hours, as they perch motionless on branches, resembling a broken tree branch.

2. **Large, Wide Mouth:** These birds have a distinctive large and wide mouth, which aids in catching insects, small vertebrates, and other prey. Their diet mainly consists of nocturnal insects, making them effective hunters in low-light conditions.

3. **Nocturnal Behavior:** Tawny Frogmouths are primarily nocturnal, meaning they are most active during the night. Their nocturnal habits contribute to their efficient hunting of insects and other prey under the cover of darkness.

4. **Wide, Flat Face:** The Tawny Frogmouth has a wide and flat face with a prominent facial disk, resembling that of an owl. While they share some physical features with owls, they are not closely related and belong to a different avian family.

5. **Tree-Nesting Habits:** Tawny Frogmouths are cavity-nesters, often choosing horizontal branches or tree forks to build their nests. They lay 2-3 eggs, and both parents are involved in incubating the eggs and caring for the chicks. The choice of tree-nesting locations further enhances their camouflage and protection from predators.
