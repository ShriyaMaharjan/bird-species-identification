Origin:
The Indian Pitta (Pitta brachyura) is a colorful and distinctive bird species native to the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia. It inhabits a variety of forested habitats, including deciduous and evergreen forests, where it forages for insects and small invertebrates on the forest floor.

Characteristics:
1. **Vibrant Plumage:** Indian Pittas are renowned for their vibrant and striking plumage, characterized by a combination of bright colors such as green, blue, yellow, and red. This colorful appearance makes them visually appealing and easily identifiable within their dense forest habitats.
2. **Distinctive Markings:** The Indian Pitta features distinctive markings on its face and breast, including a black stripe running from the eye to the nape of the neck and a broad chest band. These markings contribute to the bird's unique and attractive pattern.
3. **Ground-Feeding Behavior:** One of the notable behaviors of the Indian Pitta is its ground-feeding habit. It hops and bobs along the forest floor, using its sharp beak to probe the leaf litter for insects, worms, and other small invertebrates.
4. **Seasonal Migration:** Indian Pittas are known for their seasonal migration, moving to different elevations in response to changes in weather and food availability. They are often found in lowland forests during the breeding season and migrate to higher elevations during the non-breeding period.
5. **Distinctive Calls:** The Indian Pitta is recognized by its distinctive and melodious calls, often described as a series of clear, whistling notes. These calls are essential for communication between individuals, especially during the breeding season.
