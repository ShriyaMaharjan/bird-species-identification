Origin:
The King Vulture (Sarcoramphus papa) is a majestic bird found in the Americas, predominantly inhabiting tropical lowland forests from southern Mexico to northern Argentina. Known for its impressive size and distinctive appearance, the King Vulture is a prominent scavenger that plays a crucial role in the ecosystems it inhabits.

Characteristics:
1. **Large Size:** The King Vulture is one of the largest vulture species, with a wingspan ranging from 5.5 to 6 feet (1.7 to 1.8 meters) and a length of about 27 to 32 inches (69 to 81 centimeters).
2. **Multicolored Plumage:** Distinguished by its vibrant and multicolored plumage, the King Vulture possesses a striking combination of white, black, and orange or pink feathers on its head and neck. This unique coloration sets it apart from other vulture species.
3. **Powerful Beak:** Equipped with a powerful, hooked beak, the King Vulture is well-adapted for tearing through tough animal hides and accessing the internal organs of its carrion prey. The strong beak allows it to efficiently consume a wide range of carcasses.
4. **Keen Eyesight:** Known for its exceptional eyesight, the King Vulture can spot carrion from high altitudes during flight. This keen vision helps it locate food sources and compete with other scavengers for access to carcasses.
5. **Social Behavior:** King Vultures are often observed in groups, exhibiting social behavior around carrion. They may share feeding sites with other vultures, displaying a hierarchical structure where dominant individuals have priority access to the carcass.
