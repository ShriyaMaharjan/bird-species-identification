The Emerald Tanager (Tangara florida) is a dazzling bird species found in the Andes Mountains of South America, specifically in countries like Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. Inhabiting montane forests, these tanagers add vibrant splashes of color to their high-altitude habitats.

As for its characteristics:
1. **Iridescent Plumage:** The Emerald Tanager is renowned for its striking iridescent plumage, which features brilliant shades of green and turquoise. The vibrant colors make it a visually captivating species in its montane forest environment.
2. **Small Size:** These tanagers are relatively small birds, measuring around 13 centimeters (5 inches) in length. Their compact size allows them to navigate the dense vegetation of their forested habitats with agility.
3. **Social Behavior:** Emerald Tanagers are often observed in small flocks, and they exhibit social behaviors such as foraging together for insects and small fruits. Their communal nature contributes to their adaptability in their montane ecosystems.
4. **Altitudinal Migration:** These tanagers are known for altitudinal migration, moving to different elevations within their mountainous habitats in response to changes in food availability and climate. This behavior allows them to optimize their resource use.
5. **Distinctive Vocalizations:** While generally not as vocal as some other tanager species, Emerald Tanagers produce high-pitched calls and soft warbles. These vocalizations are used for communication within flocks and may serve a role in establishing territory or attracting mates.
