The Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) is a bird species native to North America, with its range extending from the eastern parts of the United States to parts of Canada and Mexico.

As for its characteristics:
1. **Distinctive Plumage:** Eastern Towhees exhibit sexually dimorphic plumage. Males have striking black upperparts, a rufous side, and white underparts, while females have a more subdued coloration with brown tones replacing the black.
2. **Scratching Foraging Style:** These birds are known for their ground-feeding habits. They use a distinctive backward hop-and-scratch motion with both feet to uncover insects, seeds, and leaf litter, making rustling sounds that can aid in their detection.
3. **Vocalizations:** Eastern Towhees have a variety of vocalizations, including a distinctive "drink-your-tea" call, often used as a diagnostic identification feature. Males may also produce a melodious song to establish territory during the breeding season.
4. **Shy and Elusive Behavior:** Towhees are generally shy and elusive birds, preferring to stay hidden in dense vegetation. Their cryptic behavior and ground-feeding habits make them more often heard than seen.
5. **Nesting on the Ground:** Eastern Towhees typically build their nests on or near the ground. The female constructs a cup-shaped nest in thick vegetation, often well-hidden to protect it from potential predators. Both parents participate in caring for the eggs and chicks during the breeding season.
