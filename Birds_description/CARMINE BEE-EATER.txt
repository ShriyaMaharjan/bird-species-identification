Origin:
The Carmine Bee-eater (Merops nubicoides) is a bird species native to sub-Saharan Africa. Its range extends from parts of West Africa to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Senegal, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, and South Africa. These vibrant bee-eaters are commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and near water sources.

Characteristics:
1. **Vibrant Plumage:** Carmine Bee-eaters are renowned for their stunning and vibrant plumage, characterized by bright carmine or deep pink feathers on their underparts, wings, and elongated central tail feathers.
2. **Long, Slender Bills:** These birds have long, slender bills adapted for catching and consuming flying insects, particularly bees and other pollinators. Their specialized bills aid in their aerial feeding behaviors.
3. **Colonial Nesting:** Carmine Bee-eaters are known for their colonial nesting habits. They often breed in large colonies where they excavate burrows in sandy banks, creating nesting sites for laying eggs and raising their chicks.
4. **Aerial Acrobatics:** Highly skilled in aerial acrobatics, Carmine Bee-eaters are adept fliers, capable of catching insects mid-air. Their agile flight allows them to navigate through open landscapes in pursuit of flying prey.
5. **Migratory Behavior:** Some populations of Carmine Bee-eaters are migratory, undertaking seasonal movements in search of favorable breeding and feeding grounds. Their migration patterns contribute to their adaptability across a variety of habitats within their extensive range.
