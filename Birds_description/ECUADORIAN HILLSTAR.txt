The Ecuadorian Hillstar (Oreotrochilus chimborazo) is a hummingbird species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes Mountains in Ecuador and northern Peru. Thriving in alpine and paramo ecosystems, this species has adapted to the challenging conditions of its lofty habitat.

As for its characteristics:
1. **Altitudinal Range:** The Ecuadorian Hillstar is adapted to high elevations, typically found in the paramo and puna zones of the Andes, ranging from around 3,500 to 5,000 meters (11,500 to 16,400 feet) above sea level.
2. **Distinctive Plumage:** These hummingbirds are recognized for their striking plumage, often featuring a combination of iridescent greens and blues on their upperparts, with a contrasting white or pale-colored underbelly. The vibrant colors contribute to their visual appeal.
3. **Specialized Feeding:** Hillstars have evolved to feed on high-altitude flowering plants, using their specialized long bills to access nectar from tubular flowers. They play a crucial role in pollination within their alpine habitats.
4. **Territorial Behavior:** Ecuadorian Hillstars are known for their territorial nature, vigorously defending feeding territories against other hummingbirds. Their aggressive behavior is particularly pronounced during the breeding season.
5. **Seasonal Movements:** Due to the extreme conditions of their high-altitude habitats, Ecuadorian Hillstars may engage in seasonal movements, descending to lower elevations during the non-breeding season when resources become scarcer in their typical range.
