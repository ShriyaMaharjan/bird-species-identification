The Woodland Kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis) is a bird species native to sub-Saharan Africa. Found in a variety of wooded habitats, including savannas, woodlands, and riverine areas, these kingfishers are known for their striking appearance and distinct behaviors.

Characteristics:
1. **Vibrant Plumage:** The Woodland Kingfisher is characterized by its vibrant blue and white plumage, with a bright blue crown and wings contrasting against a white throat and underparts. This eye-catching coloration contributes to its visibility in the dense vegetation of its habitat.

2. **Territorial Calls:** These kingfishers are renowned for their loud and melodious calls, often heard during the breeding season. Their territorial calls serve multiple purposes, including establishing and defending breeding territories and attracting mates.

3. **Aerial Foraging:** Woodland Kingfishers primarily feed on insects, small vertebrates, and occasionally fish. They employ an aerial foraging technique, where they hover briefly before diving to catch prey from the ground. This agile hunting behavior is well-suited to their woodland environment.

4. **Nesting Habits:** The Woodland Kingfisher typically nests in tree cavities, using natural hollows or abandoned nests of other birds. The choice of nesting sites varies, and they may also use termite mounds or holes in riverbanks for breeding.

5. **Migratory Behavior:** While some populations of Woodland Kingfishers are resident year-round, others are migratory, undertaking seasonal movements in response to changing weather patterns and food availability. The migratory behavior of these birds contributes to their adaptability across different regions of sub-Saharan Africa.
