Origin:
Guineafowl, belonging to the family Numididae, are native to Africa, particularly sub-Saharan regions. They inhabit a variety of habitats including savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands. These birds have also been introduced to other parts of the world due to their value as domestic poultry. Guineafowl are known for their distinctive appearance and loud, raucous calls.

Characteristics:
1. Plumage: Guineafowl are characterized by their speckled plumage, with black or dark brown feathers adorned with white spots or stripes. This pattern provides effective camouflage in their natural habitat.
2. Helmeted Guineafowl: One of the most common species is the Helmeted Guineafowl (Numida meleagris), recognized by its prominent helmet-like casque on top of its head.
3. Social Behavior: Guineafowl are highly social birds, often seen foraging, roosting, and nesting in groups called "confusions" or "flocks." They have a complex social hierarchy within these groups.
4. Foraging Habits: These birds are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of plant matter, seeds, insects, and small invertebrates. They are known to scratch the ground with their feet to uncover food.
5. Loud Calls: Guineafowl are known for their loud and distinctive calls, which can carry over long distances. These calls serve as a means of communication within the group, alerting others to potential threats or signaling the location of food sources.
