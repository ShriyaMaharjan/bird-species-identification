The Umbrellabird, specifically the Long-wattled Umbrellabird (Cephalopterus penduliger), is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, including regions of Costa Rica and Panama. Known for its distinctive appearance, the Umbrellabird inhabits montane forests characterized by high humidity and lush vegetation.

Characteristics:
1. **Large Size:** The Umbrellabird is a sizable bird, with males being particularly large and exhibiting a pendulous wattle hanging from the throat. This wattle can be extended during displays and plays a role in the bird's unique courtship behavior.

2. **Crested Appearance:** Both males and females of the Long-wattled Umbrellabird feature a prominent crest on the head, adding to their overall striking appearance. The crest, when raised, enhances their regal and umbrella-like profile.

3. **Dietary Habits:** Umbrellabirds are frugivores, primarily consuming fruits and berries in their forest habitat. They play a crucial role in seed dispersal, contributing to the ecological balance of the forest ecosystem.

4. **Elaborate Courtship Displays:** During the breeding season, male Umbrellabirds engage in elaborate courtship displays to attract females. These displays may involve the extension of the pendulous wattle, accompanied by vocalizations and movements to establish their prowess and attract a mate.

5. **Vocalizations:** Umbrellabirds are known for their distinctive vocalizations, including deep, booming calls. Their calls serve various purposes, including communication within the group, establishing territories, and signaling during courtship displays.
