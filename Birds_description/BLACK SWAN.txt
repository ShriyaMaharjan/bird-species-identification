The Black Swan, scientifically referred to as Cygnus atratus, is a large waterbird native to Australia. Despite its name, the Black Swan is not entirely black; it is known for its black plumage with striking white flight feathers that are visible in flight. These graceful birds inhabit various aquatic habitats such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands across Australia, where they primarily feed on aquatic plants and algae. Black Swans are monogamous and form strong pair bonds, often remaining with the same mate for life. They are also known for their distinctive trumpet-like calls and elegant swimming.
