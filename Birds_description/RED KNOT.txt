The Red Knot (Calidris canutus) is a bird species with a circumpolar breeding distribution in the Arctic tundra regions. This long-distance migratory bird travels incredible distances between its breeding grounds in the Arctic and its non-breeding areas in the Southern Hemisphere, including coastal habitats in Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Americas.

Characterized by specific traits, the Red Knot exhibits several distinctive features:

1. **Variable Plumage:** Red Knots showcase variable plumage throughout the year. During the breeding season, they often have a reddish-brown coloration, while in non-breeding plumage, they display a more subdued grayish-brown appearance.

2. **Long-Distance Migration:** Renowned for their remarkable migratory journeys, Red Knots undertake one of the longest migrations of any bird species. They travel thousands of kilometers between their Arctic breeding grounds and the warmer wintering areas in the Southern Hemisphere.

3. **Specialized Bill:** Red Knots have a distinctive long and straight bill, adapted for probing into the sand to extract invertebrates, particularly during their stopovers on mudflats where they refuel during migration.

4. **Gregarious Behavior:** These birds are often observed in large flocks, particularly during migration and on their wintering grounds. Their social behavior extends to cooperative feeding and roosting.

5. **Feeding on Horseshoe Crab Eggs:** During their migration stopovers, especially in the Delaware Bay area, Red Knots rely heavily on horseshoe crab eggs as a critical food source. The timing of their migration coincides with the availability of these eggs.

These characteristics collectively define the Red Knot as an adaptable and migratory shorebird, playing a crucial role in the interconnected ecosystems of both the Arctic and the Southern Hemisphere.
