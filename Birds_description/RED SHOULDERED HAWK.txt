The Red-shouldered Hawk (Buteo lineatus) is a bird of prey native to North America. Its range extends from southern Canada to Mexico, and it is particularly prevalent in deciduous and mixed woodlands, where it can be found perched in trees or soaring over open areas.

Characterized by specific traits, the Red-shouldered Hawk exhibits several distinctive features:

1. **Reddish Shoulders:** Adult Red-shouldered Hawks have striking reddish-brown patches on their shoulders, which are a key feature that distinguishes them from other hawks.

2. **Distinctive Call:** The Red-shouldered Hawk is known for its distinctive vocalizations, including a loud, piercing scream that is often heard in its forested habitat. These calls serve various purposes, including communication with a mate and territorial signaling.

3. **Broad Wings and Short Tail:** This hawk has broad wings and a relatively short tail, which makes it well-adapted for navigating through wooded areas and maneuvering among trees during hunting.

4. **Prey Selection:** Red-shouldered Hawks primarily prey on small mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and insects. Their hunting strategy often involves perching in a concealed location and ambushing prey from above.

5. **Nesting in Trees:** These hawks build nests in trees, constructing platforms of sticks and lining them with softer materials. They often reuse nests in subsequent breeding seasons and may be territorial around their nesting sites.

These characteristics collectively define the Red-shouldered Hawk as an adaptable and skilled predator, thriving in the diverse ecosystems of North American woodlands.
