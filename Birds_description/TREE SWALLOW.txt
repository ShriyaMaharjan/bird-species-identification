1. **Wide Distribution:** The Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) is a widely distributed bird species native to North America. These swallows inhabit a range that spans from Alaska and Canada through the United States, extending into parts of Mexico and Central America.

2. **Iridescent Blue Plumage:** Tree Swallows are recognized for their striking iridescent blue plumage on their upperparts, with white underparts. Males typically display more vibrant blue coloring, while females may have slightly duller hues.

3. **Cavity-Nesting Behavior:** These swallows are cavity nesters, utilizing pre-existing tree cavities, nest boxes, or even abandoned woodpecker holes for nesting. Their adaptability to artificial nest boxes has made conservation efforts successful in promoting their populations.

4. **Insectivorous Diet:** Tree Swallows primarily feed on flying insects, including flies, mosquitoes, and beetles. Their aerial foraging involves agile and acrobatic flights as they catch insects on the wing. They are often observed near water bodies where insect concentrations are high.

5. **Migratory Nature:** Tree Swallows are migratory birds, undertaking long-distance journeys between their breeding and wintering grounds. They breed in northern regions during the summer and migrate to southern regions, including the southern United States and Central America, for the winter.
