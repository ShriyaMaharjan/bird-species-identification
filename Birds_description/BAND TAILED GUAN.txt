The Band-tailed Guan, scientifically known as Penelope argyrotis, is a species of bird native to the highland forests of Central and South America. These guans are primarily found in regions such as the Andes Mountains, from Venezuela and Colombia to Bolivia and Argentina. Band-tailed Guans inhabit montane forests and cloud forests, where they forage for fruits, seeds, and small invertebrates. They are known for their distinctive appearance, with grayish plumage, a prominent white band on their tails, and a bare patch of skin around their eyes.
