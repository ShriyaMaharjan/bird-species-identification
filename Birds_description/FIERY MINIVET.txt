Origin:
The Fiery Minivet (Pericrocotus igneus) is a bird species native to the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia. These minivets inhabit a range of forested habitats, including tropical and subtropical forests, where they can be found perched in the canopy and mid-canopy levels. With their vibrant plumage and agile flight, Fiery Minivets add a burst of color to the diverse avian fauna of the regions they inhabit.

Characteristics:
1. **Vibrant Plumage:** The Fiery Minivet is known for its striking plumage, featuring bright orange-red and black colors in males, while females have a more subdued yellowish-green plumage.
2. **Insectivorous Diet:** These minivets primarily feed on insects, catching prey in mid-air or gleaning from foliage in the forest canopy, showcasing their agile and acrobatic foraging behavior.
3. **Social Nature:** Fiery Minivets are often observed in small groups or mixed-species flocks, displaying social behaviors that include communication through soft calls and maintaining proximity while foraging.
4. **Nesting in Trees:** They construct cup-shaped nests on tree branches, using a combination of twigs, leaves, and fibers to create a well-protected environment for their eggs and chicks.
5. **Seasonal Migration:** Some populations of Fiery Minivets are known to undertake seasonal migrations, moving between breeding and non-breeding areas in response to changes in food availability and environmental conditions.
