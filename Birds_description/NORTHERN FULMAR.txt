The Northern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) is a seabird species that primarily inhabits the subarctic and polar regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its origin is tied to the cold, open waters of the Arctic and North Atlantic, where it thrives in marine environments. The Northern Fulmar is well-adapted to life at sea and is known for its unique characteristics that aid in its survival in harsh, frigid conditions.

1. Northern Fulmars have a distinctive appearance, characterized by a robust body, short neck, and medium-length wings. Their plumage varies, but it typically includes shades of gray and white, contributing to their overall sleek and streamlined look.

2. These seabirds are highly skilled gliders, capable of covering vast distances over the open ocean. They use dynamic soaring and gliding techniques to harness wind currents, reducing the energy expended during long flights.

3. Northern Fulmars possess specialized salt glands that allow them to excrete excess salt from the seawater they consume, enabling them to drink saltwater without compromising their hydration levels.

4. One notable defense mechanism of the Northern Fulmar is its ability to eject stomach oil as a deterrent against predators. This foul-smelling, oily substance can be projected at potential threats, serving as a deterrent and a means of defense.

5. Northern Fulmars exhibit colonial nesting behavior, forming large breeding colonies on cliffs and rocky ledges. They lay a single egg in simple nests constructed with rocks and other available materials, and both parents participate in incubating the egg and caring for the chick.
