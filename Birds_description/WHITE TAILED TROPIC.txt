The White-tailed Trogon (Trogon viridis) is native to Central and South America, inhabiting tropical and subtropical forests from Mexico to Brazil. These striking birds are known for their vibrant plumage and can often be found perched motionless in the dense foliage of their preferred habitats.

Characteristics:
1. **Colorful Plumage:** White-tailed Trogons exhibit a stunning combination of green, blue, and red plumage. Males typically feature a metallic green back, blue throat, and red belly, while females have a more muted coloration. The distinctive white tail feathers contribute to their name.

2. **Specialized Perching:** Trogons are known for their unique perching behavior. They often perch on horizontal branches, remaining motionless for extended periods while waiting for prey. This stationary pose helps them blend into the foliage and facilitates surprise attacks on insects and small vertebrates.

3. **Fruit-Eating Diet:** White-tailed Trogons have a primarily frugivorous diet, feeding on a variety of fruits. They may also consume insects and small vertebrates, capturing prey with a swift and precise motion when hunting from their perches.

4. **Distinctive Vocalizations:** Trogons are recognized by their distinctive vocalizations, including a series of soft cooing or hooting sounds. These calls play a role in communication within mated pairs and in establishing territorial boundaries within their forested habitats.

5. **Cavity Nesting:** White-tailed Trogons often nest in tree cavities, using natural hollows or abandoned nests created by other birds. Their choice of nesting sites, often high above the ground, provides protection for their eggs and chicks from ground-based predators.
