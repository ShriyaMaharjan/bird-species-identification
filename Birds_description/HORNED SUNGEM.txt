This dazzling hummingbird species is renowned for its iridescent plumage, with males displaying vibrant hues of green, blue, and purple, adorned with distinctive elongated feathers on the head resembling horns, hence its name. These birds are primarily found in high-altitude environments, where they utilize their specialized beaks to feed on nectar from a variety of flowering plants, contributing to pollination in their ecosystem.
