The Red-faced Cormorant (Phalacrocorax urile) is a bird species native to the coastal regions of the North Pacific, particularly found in areas such as the Aleutian Islands, parts of Alaska, and eastern Russia. This cormorant species is well-adapted to marine environments and rocky coastal habitats.

Characterized by specific traits, the Red-faced Cormorant exhibits several distinctive features:

1. **Red Facial Skin:** Adult Red-faced Cormorants are easily identified by the vibrant red facial skin, particularly during the breeding season. The red coloration is prominent around the eyes and base of the bill.

2. **Dark Plumage:** These cormorants have dark plumage overall, appearing blackish or dark brown. The dark coloration aids in thermoregulation, as it absorbs sunlight to help regulate body temperature during periods of drying.

3. **Webbed Feet:** Adapted for a marine lifestyle, Red-faced Cormorants have webbed feet, enabling efficient swimming and diving. They are skilled underwater hunters, preying on fish and other aquatic organisms.

4. **Colonial Nesting:** Red-faced Cormorants often nest in colonies on coastal cliffs or rocky outcrops. Their nests are constructed with seaweed, grass, and other materials, providing a secure location for breeding.

5. **Distinctive Bill Shape:** These cormorants have a long and hooked bill, well-suited for capturing and holding onto slippery prey. Their diet consists mainly of fish, which they catch by diving beneath the water's surface.

These characteristics collectively define the Red-faced Cormorant as an adapted and visually distinctive seabird, contributing to the coastal ecosystems of the North Pacific region.
