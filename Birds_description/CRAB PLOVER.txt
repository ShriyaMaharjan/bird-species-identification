The Crab Plover (Dromas ardeola) is a bird species found along the coasts of the Indian Ocean and parts of Southeast Asia. Inhabiting sandy beaches, mudflats, and estuaries, this distinctive shorebird is known for its specialized feeding habits and striking appearance.

1. **Size:** The Crab Plover is a medium to large-sized shorebird, with adults typically measuring around 40 to 45 centimeters in length.

2. **Plumage:** Characterized by a contrasting black and white coloration, this plover species has a predominantly black upper body, white underparts, and a distinctive black mask around the eyes. The plumage adaptation aids in camouflage against the sandy and muddy backgrounds of its coastal habitats.

3. **Feeding Behavior:** Crab Plovers are specialized feeders, primarily preying on crabs. They use their strong bills to extract and consume crabs, often seen foraging along the shoreline during low tide. This unique feeding habit sets them apart from other shorebirds.

4. **Habitat:** These plovers are typically found in coastal environments, including sandy beaches, mudflats, and tidal areas. They are often observed in regions with a plentiful supply of crabs for their dietary needs.

5. **Breeding:** Crab Plovers form breeding colonies on sandy islands and coastal areas. They nest in burrows in the sand, where they lay eggs and raise their chicks. Breeding colonies may consist of a few to several hundred pairs.

These characteristics collectively define the Crab Plover as a specialized and visually striking shorebird, well-adapted to the coastal ecosystems of the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia.
