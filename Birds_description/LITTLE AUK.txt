Origin:
The Little Auk (Alle alle), also known as the Dovekie, is a circumpolar seabird that breeds in the Arctic regions. This petite member of the auk family has a circumpolar distribution, nesting on coastal cliffs and offshore islands across the Arctic, from North America to Europe and Asia. Its breeding colonies are often situated in remote and harsh environments, where it takes advantage of the rich marine food resources during the breeding season.

Characteristics:
1. Small Stature: The Little Auk is characterized by its diminutive size, with adults typically measuring around 19 to 23 centimeters in length. Despite its small stature, it is a highly resilient and capable flyer.
2. Black and White Plumage: Sporting a distinctive black and white plumage, the Little Auk's coloration provides effective camouflage against the Arctic landscape and icy waters. Its dark upperparts and white underparts contribute to its cryptic appearance.
3. Rapid Flight: Known for its agile and rapid flight, the Little Auk is adept at navigating through the air, often flying low over the water's surface. This skill is crucial for efficient foraging and evading predators.
4. Fish-based Diet: The Little Auk primarily feeds on small fish and invertebrates, diving underwater to catch its prey. Its diet is well-adapted to the cold, nutrient-rich waters of the Arctic, where it takes advantage of the abundance of marine life.
5. Colonial Breeding: Little Auks are colonial breeders, nesting in large colonies on cliffs or rocky outcrops. They exhibit strong fidelity to their nesting sites, returning to the same locations year after year to breed and raise their chicks, demonstrating a remarkable adaptation to the challenging Arctic environment.
