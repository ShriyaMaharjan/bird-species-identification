The Emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) is a large flightless bird native to Australia, particularly widespread across the continent, inhabiting a range of environments from forests to grasslands. As the world's second-largest bird by height, the Emu holds a prominent place in Australia's fauna.

As for its characteristics:
1. **Size:** Emus are characterized by their significant size, standing between 5 to 6.6 feet (1.5 to 2 meters) tall. They are the largest bird in Australia and are known for their long legs and neck.
2. **Flightless:** Despite having strong, well-developed wings, Emus are flightless birds. Instead, they are exceptional runners and can reach speeds of up to 30 miles per hour (48 kilometers per hour).
3. **Distinctive Plumage:** These birds have shaggy, brown feathers that provide effective camouflage in their natural habitats. The feathers are adapted to insulate them from both high and low temperatures.
4. **Omnivorous Diet:** Emus are omnivores, feeding on a diverse diet that includes plants, fruits, insects, and small vertebrates. Their opportunistic feeding behavior allows them to adapt to various environmental conditions.
5. **Breeding Behavior:** Emus are known for their elaborate courtship rituals. After forming pairs during the breeding season, females lay large, dark-green eggs, and males take on the responsibility of incubating the eggs and caring for the chicks once they hatch.
