The Scarlet Ibis (Eudocimus ruber) is a bird species native to the coastal regions of northern South America and islands in the Caribbean. Its striking appearance and vibrant plumage have made it an iconic species in its range, particularly in wetland habitats.

Characterized by traits that define its identity within the coastal and marshy environments it inhabits, the Scarlet Ibis exhibits the following features:

1. **Neotropical Distribution:** Scarlet Ibises are native to the northern parts of South America, including countries such as Venezuela, Brazil, Guyana, Suriname, and parts of the Caribbean, where they inhabit coastal areas, mangroves, and wetlands.

2. **Vivid Scarlet Plumage:** The most distinctive characteristic of the Scarlet Ibis is its vibrant scarlet or orange-pink plumage. This coloration is attributed to the pigments in the crustaceans and other aquatic organisms that the bird consumes. The intensity of the color varies based on the bird's diet and age.

3. **Long, Decurved Bill:** Scarlet Ibises have a long and decurved bill, which is adapted for probing into mud and shallow water to capture crustaceans, small fish, and other aquatic invertebrates. Their specialized bill aids in their feeding behavior in wetland habitats.

4. **Colonial Nesting:** These birds often engage in colonial nesting, where large groups of individuals gather to breed. They build nests in trees, shrubs, or on mangrove branches, creating a communal environment for nesting and raising their chicks.

5. **Migratory Behavior:** While some populations of Scarlet Ibises are sedentary, others exhibit migratory behavior, moving in response to changes in food availability or environmental conditions. Their movements may be influenced by the seasonal fluctuations of water levels in their wetland habitats.
