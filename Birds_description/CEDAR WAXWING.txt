Origin:
The Cedar Waxwing (Bombycilla cedrorum) is a bird species native to North America, with a range extending from southern Canada through the United States and into parts of Mexico. These elegant songbirds inhabit a variety of environments, including open woodlands, orchards, and suburban areas.

Characteristics:
1. **Sleek Plumage:** Cedar Waxwings are characterized by their sleek and silky plumage, featuring a mix of brown, gray, and lemon-yellow tones. They have distinctive black masks on their faces and a waxy red appendage at the tips of their secondary flight feathers.
2. **Crestless Crown:** Unlike some waxwing species, the Cedar Waxwing lacks a prominent crest on its head. The head is typically adorned with a subtle crest, contributing to its streamlined appearance.
3. **Fruit-Eating Diet:** These birds have a primarily frugivorous diet, feeding on a variety of berries and fruits. Their specialized digestive system allows them to efficiently process fruit sugars and seeds, making them important dispersers of plant seeds.
4. **Social Behavior:** Cedar Waxwings are highly social birds, often observed in large flocks. Their social structure aids in cooperative foraging and provides protection against predators.
5. **Whistling Calls:** Known for their soft and high-pitched whistling calls, Cedar Waxwings communicate within their flocks during flight and while perched. These calls are a distinctive feature of their presence in the varied landscapes they inhabit.
