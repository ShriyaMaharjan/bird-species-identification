Origin:
The Greater Pewee (Contopus pertinax) is a species of bird belonging to the tyrant flycatcher family, Tyrannidae. Native to the western regions of North America, including parts of the United States and Mexico, this bird prefers montane and foothill forests as its habitat. It can often be found perched atop tall trees, where it hunts for insects and small prey, making occasional sallies to catch flying insects mid-air. The Greater Pewee is recognized for its distinctive call, which resonates through the woodlands of its range.

Characteristics:
1. Size: Relatively large among flycatchers, with a length averaging around 7.5 inches (19 centimeters).
2. Plumage: Possesses muted brownish-gray upperparts with a paler underside, often blending well with the bark of trees in its habitat.
3. Vocalizations: Emits a sharp, whistled "pe-wee" call, which serves as its namesake and is commonly heard during the breeding season.
4. Feeding Behavior: Primarily insectivorous, catching prey through sallies from perches and occasionally hovering to snatch flying insects.
5. Breeding Habits: Constructs cup-shaped nests made of plant fibers, spider webs, and other materials, typically placed in the branches of tall trees, where it lays eggs and raises its young.
