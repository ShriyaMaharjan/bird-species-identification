The Baikal Teal, scientifically known as Sibirionetta formosa, is a species of duck native to East Asia. These teal are primarily found in regions such as Siberia, Mongolia, China, Japan, and Korea. Baikal Teals inhabit various wetland habitats, including marshes, lakes, ponds, and rivers, where they forage for aquatic plants, seeds, and invertebrates. They are known for their striking plumage, with males displaying vibrant patterns of iridescent green, chestnut, and white, while females have more subdued brown coloring.

1. Plumage: The Baikal Teal exhibits striking plumage, with males displaying vibrant patterns of iridescent green, chestnut, and white, particularly on their heads and wings, while females have more subdued brown coloring with mottled patterns for camouflage.
2. Habitat: These ducks are native to East Asia, where they primarily inhabit wetland habitats such as marshes, lakes, ponds, and rivers, particularly during the breeding season.
3. Migratory Behavior: Baikal Teals are migratory birds, undertaking long-distance migrations between their breeding grounds in Siberia and their wintering grounds in East Asia, including parts of China, Korea, and Japan.
4. Feeding Habits: They primarily feed on aquatic plants, seeds, and invertebrates, which they gather by dabbling in shallow water or grazing on vegetation along the water's edge.
5. Social Behavior: Baikal Teals are often observed in large flocks during the non-breeding season, congregating in wetland habitats where food is abundant and forming mixed-species flocks with other waterfowl species.
