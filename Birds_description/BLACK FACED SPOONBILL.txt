The Black-faced Spoonbill, scientifically known as Platalea minor, is a distinctive wading bird belonging to the Threskiornithidae family. Originating from East Asia, particularly regions such as China, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, these elegant birds inhabit coastal wetlands, estuaries, and mudflats during their breeding and migration seasons. They are characterized by their striking black facial markings and unique spoon-shaped bills, which they use to sift through shallow water to catch small aquatic invertebrates and fish. Black-faced Spoonbills are social birds, often observed foraging and roosting in large flocks, particularly during migration periods. Their populations are vulnerable to habitat loss and disturbance, leading to conservation efforts to protect their critical breeding and wintering grounds.
