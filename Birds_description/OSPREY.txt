Origin:
The Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) is a widespread bird of prey found on every continent except Antarctica. Its global distribution includes regions of North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America. Ospreys exhibit a preference for coastal habitats, inland water bodies, and large freshwater ecosystems, where they are known for their remarkable fishing abilities.

Characteristics:
1. **Fish-Eating Adaptation:** The Osprey is well adapted for fishing, with specialized features such as reversible outer toes and spiny soles on its feet. These adaptations aid in gripping slippery fish and enhance its ability to hunt successfully in aquatic environments.
2. **Distinctive Plumage:** Ospreys have a distinctive appearance, characterized by dark brown upperparts, a white head, and a white underbelly with a mottled pattern. This coloration provides effective camouflage while perched and during their aerial pursuits over water.
3. **Winged Migration:** Ospreys are known for their impressive long-distance migrations. Populations from the Northern Hemisphere migrate to warmer regions in the Southern Hemisphere during the non-breeding season, showcasing their remarkable navigational skills.
4. **Large Size:** As one of the larger raptors, Ospreys have a wingspan ranging from about 150 to 180 centimeters (59 to 71 inches), and adults can weigh between 1 to 2 kilograms (2.2 to 4.4 pounds), with females being slightly larger than males.
5. **Nesting Platforms:** Ospreys build large stick nests on elevated structures such as dead trees, utility poles, or specialized nesting platforms. Their nests are often reused and expanded over successive breeding seasons, contributing to their long-term occupancy in specific territories.
