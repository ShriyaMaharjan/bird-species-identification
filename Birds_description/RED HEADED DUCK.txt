The Red-headed Duck (Aythya americana) is a bird species native to North America, particularly found in the central and western regions of the continent. Its breeding range extends from the prairie pothole regions of the United States and Canada, and it winters in southern parts of the United States and Mexico.

Characterized by specific traits, the Red-headed Duck exhibits several distinctive features:

1. **Vibrant Plumage:** Adult males are known for their striking appearance, featuring a deep chestnut-red head, a black neck, and a white body. Females, while less colorful, display a more subdued brown plumage.

2. **Distinctive Bill:** Red-headed Ducks have a distinctive pale-blue bill with a black tip. This unique bill coloration sets them apart from other diving duck species.

3. **Diving Behavior:** These ducks are proficient divers, spending a significant amount of time submerged while foraging for aquatic invertebrates, seeds, and plant matter in freshwater habitats.

4. **Courtship Displays:** During the breeding season, males engage in elaborate courtship displays, which may include head bobbing, vocalizations, and various movements to attract females.

5. **Nesting in Vegetation:** Red-headed Ducks build their nests on the ground, often concealed in dense vegetation near water. The nests are constructed with grasses, reeds, and other plant materials.

These characteristics collectively define the Red-headed Duck as a visually stunning waterfowl species, contributing to the biodiversity of North American wetland ecosystems.
