Origin:
The Grandala (Grandala coelicolor) is a bird species endemic to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly found in parts of India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet. It inhabits alpine meadows and rocky slopes, often at elevations exceeding 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). The Grandala is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat, where it forages for insects and seeds while enduring extreme cold and strong winds.

Characteristics:
1. Plumage: The Grandala exhibits striking plumage characterized by shades of blue and gray, with a deep blue upperparts and a lighter gray underbelly. Its wings and tail feathers have contrasting patterns, adding to its beauty.
2. Size: It is a relatively small bird, measuring around 7 to 8 inches (18 to 20 centimeters) in length, with a wingspan of approximately 12 inches (30 centimeters).
3. Habitat Preference: Prefers high-altitude habitats above the treeline, where it can find open grasslands and rocky terrain suitable for foraging and nesting.
4. Social Behavior: The Grandala is often observed in small flocks, especially during the non-breeding season, when individuals gather to forage and roost together.
5. Breeding Habits: Constructs cup-shaped nests made of grasses and mosses, typically placed on rocky ledges or in crevices for protection from predators. Both parents share in the incubation of eggs and care for the young hatchlings until they fledge.
