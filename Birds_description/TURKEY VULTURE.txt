The Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura) is native to the Americas, with a range extending from southern Canada through the United States, down to the southern tip of South America. These vultures are highly adaptable and inhabit various environments, including forests, open country, and urban areas.

Characteristics:
1. **Large Size:** Turkey Vultures are large birds with a wingspan ranging from 5.5 to 6.5 feet (1.7 to 2 meters). Their sizable build and wingspan contribute to their efficient soaring flight.

2. **Distinctive Red Head:** One of the most recognizable features of Turkey Vultures is their featherless, red head. The bright red coloration is due to the absence of feathers, and this adaptation helps in maintaining cleanliness when feeding on carrion.

3. **Efficient Soaring Flight:** These vultures are adept at soaring on thermal updrafts, using their broad wings to cover large distances in search of carrion. Their flight pattern often involves soaring in wide circles as they scan the ground for potential food sources.

4. **Carrion Feeders:** Turkey Vultures are scavengers and primarily feed on carrion. Their keen sense of smell, unusual among birds of prey, allows them to locate and feast on carrion even from high altitudes. This scavenging behavior plays a crucial role in ecosystem cleanup.

5. **Silent and Graceful Fliers:** Despite their large size, Turkey Vultures are remarkably silent in flight. Their soaring is accompanied by few wing beats, and they exhibit a graceful gliding motion as they navigate the skies in search of carrion.
