The Razorbill (Alca torda) is a seabird species native to the northern Atlantic Ocean, particularly found in regions ranging from the Arctic to the northwestern Atlantic. This bird is well-adapted to a marine lifestyle, often inhabiting coastal cliffs and rocky islands for breeding and foraging purposes.

Characterized by specific traits, the Razorbill exhibits several distinctive features:

1. **Atlantic Distribution:** Razorbills have a broad distribution in the northern Atlantic, with breeding colonies found on both sides of the ocean, including parts of Europe, North America, and the Arctic.

2. **Black and White Plumage:** Adult Razorbills are recognized by their striking black and white plumage. They have a black upperparts, wings, and head, while the underparts are predominantly white. This coloration provides effective camouflage in the marine environment.

3. **Specialized Bill:** One of the key characteristics is their unique, vertically compressed bill with a distinct white line. The bill is adapted for capturing and holding onto fish, their primary prey, during underwater foraging.

4. **Colonial Nesting:** Razorbills nest in colonies on coastal cliffs, where they use ledges and crevices to create simple nests. Breeding colonies are often characterized by a cacophony of calls and a bustling communal atmosphere.

5. **Strong Fliers and Divers:** Razorbills are skilled fliers and divers. They use their wings for agile flight, and their strong wings and streamlined bodies allow them to plunge into the water to catch fish, squid, and other marine prey.

These characteristics collectively define the Razorbill as a well-adapted and visually distinctive seabird, contributing to the marine ecosystems of the northern Atlantic.
