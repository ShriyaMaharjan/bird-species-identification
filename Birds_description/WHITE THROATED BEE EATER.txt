The White-throated Bee-eater (Merops albicollis) is native to sub-Saharan Africa, with its range spanning from Senegal in West Africa to Ethiopia in the east and southwards to South Africa. These bee-eaters inhabit various habitats, including savannas, woodlands, and open grasslands, where they are often observed perched on branches or in flight.

Characteristics:
1. **Distinctive Plumage:** White-throated Bee-eaters are characterized by their colorful plumage, featuring a combination of green, blue, and chestnut tones. The white throat and distinctive black eye stripe contribute to their overall striking appearance.

2. **Specialized Diet:** As the name suggests, these bee-eaters primarily feed on bees and other flying insects. Their diet includes a variety of bees, wasps, butterflies, and other flying arthropods, which they catch in flight using their sharp bills.

3. **Colonial Nesting:** White-throated Bee-eaters are known for their colonial nesting behavior. They often nest in burrows dug into earthen banks or cliffs, creating a series of nesting chambers where they lay their eggs and raise their chicks in a cooperative breeding system.

4. **Acrobatic Flight:** These birds are highly skilled flyers, showcasing acrobatic maneuvers during aerial pursuits of flying insects. Their swift and agile flight allows them to catch prey with precision, and they are often seen returning to perches after capturing their prey.

5. **Social Structure:** White-throated Bee-eaters are generally social birds, often seen in small groups or colonies. They engage in cooperative behaviors, such as communal roosting and cooperative breeding, where multiple individuals contribute to the care of the offspring in a shared nesting site.
