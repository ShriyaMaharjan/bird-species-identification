The Sandhill Crane (Antigone canadensis) is a large, long-legged bird species native to North America. These cranes have a wide distribution, with breeding populations found in northern North America and migratory populations spanning across various regions of the continent. Their distinctive appearance and behaviors contribute to their significance in wetland ecosystems and open landscapes.

Characterized by traits that define their identity within their diverse habitats, the Sandhill Crane exhibits the following features:

1. **North American Range:** Sandhill Cranes are native to North America, with breeding populations found in northern regions, including Alaska, Canada, and the northern United States. They inhabit a variety of wetland habitats, including marshes, bogs, and grasslands.

2. **Gray Plumage:** Adult Sandhill Cranes have predominantly gray plumage, with a contrasting red crown on their heads. Their plumage provides effective camouflage in wetland environments, helping them blend into the grasses and marsh vegetation where they forage.

3. **Impressive Size:** Sandhill Cranes are large birds, standing about 3 to 4 feet tall with a wingspan that can exceed 6 feet. Their imposing size makes them easily recognizable, especially during their distinctive flight patterns.

4. **Migratory Behavior:** Sandhill Cranes are known for their long-distance migrations, undertaking journeys that can cover thousands of miles. They breed in northern regions and migrate south for the winter, forming impressive V-shaped flight formations during migration.

5. **Trumpeting Calls:** One notable characteristic of Sandhill Cranes is their trumpeting calls. These calls, often described as bugle-like, serve various communication purposes, including signaling during flight, establishing territories, and communicating with their mate and chicks. The vocalizations are a distinctive and recognizable feature of these large birds.
