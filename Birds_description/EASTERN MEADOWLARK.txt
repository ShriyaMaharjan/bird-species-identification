The Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) is native to North America, with its range extending across a significant portion of the eastern and central United States, as well as parts of Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.

As for its characteristics:
1. **Distinctive Plumage:** Eastern Meadowlarks are characterized by their brownish-yellow plumage with black streaks on the upperparts and a bright yellow breast with a prominent V-shaped black bib on the chest. This plumage aids in camouflage within their grassland habitats.
2. **Meadow Dwelling Habitat:** True to their name, Eastern Meadowlarks inhabit open grasslands, meadows, and pastures, where they forage for insects and seeds. They are often observed perched on fence posts or in the tall grass, surveying their surroundings.
3. **Flute-like Song:** These birds are known for their flute-like song, consisting of a series of clear, melodious whistles. Their songs are integral to their communication, especially during the breeding season when males use them to establish territories and attract mates.
4. **Ground-Nesting:** Eastern Meadowlarks build their nests on the ground, typically concealed in tall grasses. The nests are cup-shaped and made of woven grasses, providing a well-hidden and secure environment for their eggs and chicks.
5. **Seasonal Migration:** While some Eastern Meadowlarks are sedentary year-round, populations in the northern parts of their range may undertake seasonal migrations, moving south during the colder months. This behavior is often influenced by food availability and weather conditions.
