Origin:
The Golden Parakeet (Guaruba guarouba) is a species of parrot native to northeastern Brazil, particularly in the Amazon Basin and adjacent regions. It inhabits tropical forests, including both dense primary forests and open woodland areas, where it feeds on a variety of fruits, seeds, nuts, and blossoms. Historically, the Golden Parakeet's range extended into parts of Suriname, French Guiana, and Guyana, but habitat loss and fragmentation have restricted its distribution primarily to Brazil.

Characteristics:
1. Plumage: The Golden Parakeet is aptly named for its vibrant golden-yellow plumage, which covers most of its body. It features contrasting green wings and tail, as well as a red patch on its forehead and a blue patch on its cheeks.
2. Size: It is a medium-sized parrot, measuring around 13 to 14 inches (33 to 36 centimeters) in length, with a wingspan of approximately 20 to 22 inches (51 to 56 centimeters).
3. Social Behavior: The Golden Parakeet is highly social and often found in large flocks, especially during the non-breeding season when individuals gather to forage, roost, and engage in social interactions.
4. Vocalizations: Communicates with a variety of vocalizations including squawks, screeches, and whistles, which are used for communication within the flock, territorial defense, and mate attraction.
5. Breeding Habits: Constructs nest cavities in tree hollows, often in large dead trees or palms, where it lays a clutch of eggs and raises its young with the assistance of its mate. Both parents share in the incubation of eggs and care for the young chicks until they fledge and become independent.
