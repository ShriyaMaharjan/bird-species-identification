Origin:
Hoopoes (Upupa epops) are widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and Africa, preferring open woodlands, savannas, and agricultural landscapes. These distinctive birds are known for their distinctive appearance and unique behaviors, including their iconic "crown" of feathers, which they can raise or lower as a display of aggression or excitement. Hoopoes are migratory in some regions, while others are resident year-round, depending on local climate and food availability.

Characteristics:
1. Crown Display: Hoopoes have a prominent erectile crest on their head, which they can raise or lower, often used in courtship displays or as a threat posture.
2. Long, Down-Curved Bill: They possess a distinctive long, slender, down-curved bill, which they use to probe soil and leaf litter in search of insects and other invertebrates.
3. Unique Flight Pattern: Hoopoes exhibit a distinctive undulating flight pattern, characterized by rhythmic flapping and gliding, accompanied by a distinctive "hoop-hoop" call.
4. Nesting Habits: They nest in cavities, often choosing holes in trees, walls, or even termite mounds, lining the nest with grass, feathers, and other soft materials.
5. Parental Care: Hoopoes are attentive parents, with both male and female participating in incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks. They regurgitate food to feed their young, often catching insects on the wing to provide a continuous food supply.
