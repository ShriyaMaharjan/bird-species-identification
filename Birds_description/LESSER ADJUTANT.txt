Origin:
The Lesser Adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), a large wading bird belonging to the stork family, finds its origin in the wetlands and marshes of South and Southeast Asia. Inhabiting a range of environments, from riverbanks to coastal areas, the Lesser Adjutant has adapted to diverse ecosystems across its native regions.

Characteristics:
1. Large Stature: The Lesser Adjutant is distinguished by its substantial size, with adults typically reaching heights of 90 to 120 centimeters and exhibiting a wingspan of around 220 to 245 centimeters.
2. Unfeathered Head and Neck: One of its prominent characteristics is the unfeathered head and neck, which appear bare and wrinkled, displaying distinctive skin folds that contribute to its unique and somewhat prehistoric appearance.
3. Long, Downward-Curved Bill: Featuring a long and robust bill that curves downward, the Lesser Adjutant employs its specialized beak to efficiently capture a varied diet, including fish, amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals.
4. Black Plumage: Adult Lesser Adjutants showcase predominantly black plumage, complemented by a white underbelly. This contrasting coloration aids in thermoregulation, as the black feathers absorb sunlight to maintain body temperature.
5. Unique Mating Rituals: During the breeding season, Lesser Adjutants engage in distinctive courtship rituals that involve vocalizations, bill-clattering, and elaborate displays of their plumage. These behaviors play a crucial role in establishing and reinforcing pair bonds.
