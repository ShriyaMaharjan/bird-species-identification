The Ruby-crowned Kinglet (Regulus calendula) is a small songbird that breeds in North America, encompassing a range from Alaska and Canada down to parts of the United States and Mexico. During the breeding season, they can be found in coniferous and mixed woodlands, and in winter, they migrate to a broader range of habitats, including deciduous forests and scrublands.

Characterized by distinctive traits, the Ruby-crowned Kinglet exhibits several notable features:

1. **Vibrant Ruby Crown:** While the ruby crown is not always visible, when excited or during displays, the male can reveal a brilliant red crown patch on its head, adding a burst of color to its otherwise olive-green and gray plumage.

2. **Tiny Size:** Among the smallest songbirds in North America, the Ruby-crowned Kinglet is known for its diminutive size, making it agile and capable of navigating through dense foliage with ease.

3. **Constantly Active:** These kinglets are highly active birds, often seen flitting from branch to branch or hovering while foraging for insects. Their perpetual motion reflects their energetic nature.

4. **Distinctive White Eye Ring:** A defining feature is the prominent white eye ring encircling its eye, providing a sharp contrast to its overall plumage.

5. **Insectivorous Diet:** Ruby-crowned Kinglets primarily feed on small insects and spiders, foraging in trees and shrubs. Their high-energy diet supports their active lifestyle.

These characteristics collectively contribute to the uniqueness and adaptability of the Ruby-crowned Kinglet, making it a delightful and dynamic presence in the North American avian landscape.
