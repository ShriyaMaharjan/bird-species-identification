The Red-bearded Bee-eater (Nyctyornis amictus) is a bird species native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as India, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Malaysia. This bee-eater inhabits a variety of forested habitats, including tropical and subtropical forests, where it can be observed perched on branches or in flight as it hunts for flying insects.

Characterized by specific traits, the Red-bearded Bee-eater exhibits several distinctive features:

1. **Vibrant Plumage:** Adult Red-bearded Bee-eaters are known for their vibrant and striking plumage. They have a combination of green, blue, and cinnamon-colored feathers, with a distinctive red patch on the throat, which gives them their name.

2. **Long Tail Feathers:** These bee-eaters possess elongated central tail feathers, creating a distinctive tail streamer that adds to their overall visual appeal. During flight, the long tail feathers are conspicuous.

3. **Bee-eating Behavior:** As the name suggests, Red-bearded Bee-eaters primarily feed on flying insects, particularly bees and wasps. They are skilled aerial hunters, catching their prey in mid-air with swift and agile maneuvers.

4. **Solitary or Pairs:** While they may be observed in pairs or small groups during the breeding season, Red-bearded Bee-eaters are generally seen as solitary birds. They may perch prominently to scan the surroundings for potential prey.

5. **Nesting in Tree Cavities:** The nesting behavior of these bee-eaters involves excavating tree cavities for their nests. The female typically lays a clutch of eggs inside the cavity, and both parents participate in incubation and caring for the chicks.

These characteristics collectively define the Red-bearded Bee-eater as a visually stunning and behaviorally distinctive bird species, contributing to the avian diversity of Southeast Asian forests.
