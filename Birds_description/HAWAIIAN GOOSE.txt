4. Herbivorous Diet: It primarily feeds on grasses, herbs, and leaves found in its habitat.
5. Conservation Efforts: Various conservation initiatives have been implemented to protect and restore the population of the Hawaiian Goose, including habitat restoration, captive breeding programs, and predator control measures.
