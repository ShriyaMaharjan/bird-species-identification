Origin:
1. **Pacific Coast of South America:** The Inca Tern (Larosterna inca) is native to the Pacific coast of South America, where it is found along the western seaboard from central Peru to central Chile. These distinctive birds inhabit coastal areas and rocky cliffs.

Characteristics:
1. **Unique Plumage:** Inca Terns are recognized for their unique and striking appearance, featuring a predominantly dark body with contrasting white facial markings. The most distinctive feature is the wispy, white mustache-like feathers that extend from the base of the bill.
2. **Reddish-Orange Bill and Feet:** Adults display a reddish-orange bill and matching webbed feet, adding vibrant colors to their overall appearance. The colorful bill plays a role in courtship displays and is thought to be an important visual cue for mating.
3. **Courtship Rituals:** Inca Terns are known for their elaborate courtship rituals, which include aerial displays, synchronized flights, and the exchange of food items between potential mates. These behaviors contribute to the formation and reinforcement of pair bonds.
4. **Fish-Eating Specialists:** Inca Terns are specialized fish eaters, and they have a distinctive hunting technique. They hover over the water and, with rapid wing beats, plunge into the sea to catch small fish near the surface. Their slender bills are adapted for grasping and consuming fish.
5. **Colonial Nesters:** Inca Terns are colonial nesters, forming breeding colonies on coastal cliffs or rocky outcrops. They construct simple nests using guano and other available materials. The colonies provide protection against predators and facilitate social interactions among individuals.
